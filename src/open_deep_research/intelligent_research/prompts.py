Research objective: {research_objective}

**Current Research State**
{previous_results_summary}

**Identified Knowledge Gaps**
{knowledge_gaps}

**Task Requirements**
1. Analyze the current research state and knowledge gaps.
2. Generate {max_queries} high-quality search queries.
3. Ensure the diversity and specificity of the queries.
4. Avoid repeating content that has been searched before.

**Query Generation Strategy**
- Breadth exploration: Understand the topic from different angles.
- In-depth analysis: Deeply research specific aspects.
- Practical orientation: Focus on practical applications and case studies.
- Gap filling: Target identified knowledge gaps.

**Output Format**
Please return the results in JSON format:

4. Determine if further research is needed.
5. If continuing, suggest the focus for the next round of research.

**Evaluation Dimensions**
- Information completeness: Does it comprehensively answer the original question?
- Content depth: Does it provide sufficient detail and analysis?
- Source reliability: Are the information sources authoritative and credible?
- Timeliness: Is the information up-to-date and relevant?
- Multi-perspective: Is the problem analyzed from multiple angles?

**Quality Levels**
- insufficient: Severely lacking information, requires significant supplementation.
- partial: Some information available, but with clear gaps.
- adequate: Basically meets research needs, may require minor supplementation.
- comprehensive: Information is complete and comprehensive, no further research needed.

   - Analyze causal relationships and internal logic.
   - Verify and question existing information.

3. **Interleaved Validation Phase**
   - Switch between breadth and depth.
   - Use new information to validate previous cognitions.
   - Adjust research focus and direction.

4. **Synthesis and Improvement Phase**
   - Integrate all research findings.
