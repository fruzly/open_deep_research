# Python Programming Language

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language renowned for its readability and clear syntax. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code clarity, allowing programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than many other languages. Its popularity is driven by its versatility across web development, data science, AI, automation, and more. The language is also celebrated for its ease of learning, extensive libraries and frameworks, a large and active community, and platform independence. These factors make Python a powerful and accessible tool for a wide range of applications and developers.
