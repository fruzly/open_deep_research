    "## 异步代码修复说明\n",
    "\n",
    "为了在Jupyter Notebook中正确运行异步代码，我们做了以下改进：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **安装nest_asyncio**: 支持嵌套事件循环，解决Jupyter环境中的异步问题\n",
    "2. **重构异步循环**: 将直接的`async for`循环包装在异步函数中\n",
    "3. **添加事件处理**: 改进了事件处理逻辑，确保正确的中断和继续机制\n",
    "4. **错误处理**: 添加了适当的break语句和事件打印\n",

Include how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs.', research=True, content=\"## Model Context Protocol (MCP): Architectural Overview for Developers\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) employs a client-server architecture to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with external context and tools [1]. Hosts, such as LLM applications or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), initiate connections and contain MCP Clients. Each Client maintains a one-to-one, stateful connection with an MCP Server, which provides capabilities like resources, tools, and prompts [1, 3, 5]. This modular design aims to simplify AI integrations by allowing servers to focus on specific functionalities [5].\\n\\nCommunication between clients and servers adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, ensuring structured message exchange via requests, responses, and one-way notifications [2, 4]. MCP is transport-agnostic, supporting Standard Input/Output (STDIO) for local processes and HTTP streaming (e.g., Server-Sent Events) or WebSockets for remote communication [1, 4].\\n\\nKey capabilities exposed by servers include: **Resources**, representing contextual data; **Tools**, which are executable functions LLMs can invoke; and **Prompts**, predefined user-controlled templates [3, 5]. Additionally, MCP supports **Sampling**, a client-side feature enabling servers to request LLM completions through the client, with user oversight [7, 9]. The connection lifecycle involves an initialization handshake where client and server negotiate capabilities, followed by message exchange [1, 4].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Core architecture - Model Context Protocol: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture\\n[2] Specification - Model Context Protocol: https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/\\n[3] A Practical Guide to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Large ...: https://artificialintelligenceschool.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-guide/\\n[4] MCP - Protocol Mechanics and Architecture | Pradeep Loganathan's Blog: https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/\\n[5] The Model Context Protocol (MCP) — A Complete Tutorial: https://medium.com/@nimritakoul01/the-model-context-protocol-mcp-a-complete-tutorial-a3abe8a7f4ef\\n[6] Specification - Model Context Protocol: https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/client/sampling/\\n[7] Sampling - Model Context Protocol （MCP）: https://modelcontextprotocol.info/docs/concepts/sampling/\\n[8] Sampling - Model Context Protocol: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling\\n[9] MCP Sampling Explained: Adding Intelligence to Your MCP Servers: https://www.mcpevals.io/blog/mcp-sampling-explained\")], 'source_str': 'Search results: \\n\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: Core architecture - Model Context Protocol ---\\nURL: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nUnderstand how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs MCP follows a client-server architecture where: The protocol layer handles message framing, request/response linking, and high-level communication patterns. class Protocol<Request, Notification, Result> { class Protocol<Request, Notification, Result> { # Request handling implementation # Request handling implementation The transport layer handles the actual communication between clients and servers. *   HTTP POST for client-to-server messages All transports use JSON-RPC 2.0 to exchange messages. 1.

All messages between MCP clients and servers MUST follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification. The protocol defines these types of messages: Requests MUST include a string or integer ID. Responses are sent in reply to requests, containing the result or error of the operation. Results MAY follow any JSON object structure, while errors MUST include an error code and message at minimum. Notifications are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, as a one-way message. The full specification of the protocol is defined as a TypeScript schema.\\n\\nFULL CONTENT:\\nBase Protocol – Model Context Protocol Specification\\n===============\\n \\n\\n  [![Image 1: Model

Protocol\\n=============\\n\\nℹ️\\n\\n**Protocol Revision**: 2025-03-26\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol consists of several key components that work together:\\n\\n*   **Base Protocol**: Core JSON-RPC message types\\n*   **Lifecycle Management**: Connection initialization, capability negotiation, and session control\\n*   **Server Features**: Resources, prompts, and tools exposed by servers\\n*   **Client Features**: Sampling and root directory lists provided by clients\\n*   **Utilities**: Cross-cutting concerns like logging and argument completion\\n\\nAll implementations **MUST** support the base protocol and lifecycle management components. Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the application.\\n\\nThese protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich interactions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to support exactly the features they need.\\n\\nMessages[](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/#messages)\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAll messages between MCP clients and servers **MUST** follow the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines these types of messages:\\n\\n### Requests[](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/#requests)\\n\\nRequests are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, to initiate an operation.\\n\\n```typescript\\n{\\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\\n  id: string | number;\\n  method: string;\\n  params?: {\\n    [key: string]: unknown;\\n  };\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*   Requests **MUST** include a string or integer ID.\\n*   Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID **MUST NOT** be `null`.\\n*   The request ID **MUST NOT** have been previously used by the requestor within the same session.\\n\\n### Responses[](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/#responses)\\n\\nResponses are sent in reply to requests, containing the result or error of the operation.\\n\\n```typescript\\n{\\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\\n  id: string | number;\\n  result?: {\\n    [key: string]: unknown;\\n  }\\n  error?: {\\n    code: number;\\n    message: string;\\n    data?: unknown;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*   Responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to.\\n*   **Responses** are further sub-categorized as either **successful results** or **errors**. Either a `result` or an `error` **MUST** be set. A response **MUST NOT** set both.\\n*   Results **MAY** follow any JSON object structure, while errors **MUST** include an error code and message at minimum.\\n*   Error codes **MUST** be integers.\\n\\n### Notifications[](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/#notifications)\\n\\nNotifications are sent from the client to the server or vice versa, as a one-way message. The receiver **MUST NOT** send a response.\\n\\n```typescript\\n{\\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\";\\n  method: string;\\n  params?: {\\n    [key: string]: unknown;\\n  };\\n}\\n```\\n\\n*   Notifications **MUST NOT** include an ID.\\n\\n### Batching[](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/#batching)\\n\\nJSON-RPC also defines a means to [batch multiple requests and notifications](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch), by sending them in an array. MCP implementations **MAY** support sending JSON-RPC batches, but **MUST** support receiving JSON-RPC batches.\\n\\nAuth[](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/#auth)\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMCP provides an [Authorization](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization/) framework for use with HTTP. Implementations using an HTTP-based transport **SHOULD** conform to this specification, whereas implementations using STDIO transport **SHOULD NOT** follow this specification, and instead retrieve credentials from the environment.\\n\\nAdditionally, clients and servers **MAY** negotiate their own custom authentication and authorization strategies.\\n\\nFor further discussions and contributions to the evolution of MCP’s auth mechanisms, join us in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions) to help shape the future of the protocol!\\n\\nSchema[](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/#schema)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe full specification of the protocol is defined as a [TypeScript schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-03-26/schema.ts). This is the source of truth for all protocol messages and structures.\\n\\nThere is also a [JSON Schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-03-26/schema.json), which is automatically generated from the TypeScript source of truth, for use with various automated tooling.\\n\\n[Powered by Hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra \"Hextra GitHub Homepage\")\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 3: A Practical Guide to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Large ... ---\\nURL: https://artificialintelligenceschool.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-guide/\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard framework that facilitates the interaction between AI models, particularly LLMs, and external data sources or services.1 Introduced by Anthropic in November 2024, MCP aims to standardize how AI assistants connect to and utilize various systems, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments.2 5.

However, their true potential is often constrained by their isolation from real-world data and external systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as a pivotal standard designed to bridge this gap, enabling LLMs to interact seamlessly and securely with a vast array of tools, databases, and services. This guide offers a detailed and practical exploration of MCP, from its fundamental concepts to advanced implementations, empowering developers to leverage this transformative protocol.\\n\\n### **Section 1: Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)**\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly becoming a cornerstone in the architecture of advanced AI systems. Understanding its core principles is essential for developers looking to build more capable and integrated LLM applications.\\n\\n#### **1.1 What is MCP? The “USB-C for AI” Analogy**\\n\\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard framework that facilitates the interaction between AI models, particularly LLMs, and external data sources or services.1 Introduced by Anthropic in November 2024, MCP aims to standardize how AI assistants connect to and utilize various systems, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments.2\\n\\nThe analogy often used to describe MCP is that of “USB-C for AI”.1 Just as USB-C provides a universal connector for a multitude of physical devices, MCP offers a standardized interface for LLMs to invoke external functions, retrieve data, or use predefined prompts in a structured, consistent, and secure manner.1 Instead of each AI application requiring bespoke code for every API or database it needs to access, MCP furnishes a common “language” for these interactions, simplifying connectivity and promoting interoperability across diverse AI systems and tools.1\\n\\n#### **1.2 Why MCP Matters: Solving the N×M Integration Problem**\\n\\nBefore the advent of MCP, integrating LLMs with external tools and data sources was a significant challenge, often described as the “N×M problem”.2 If an organization had ‘M’ different AI applications (e.g., various chatbots, custom agents) and needed to connect them to ‘N’ different external tools or systems (e.g., GitHub, Slack, internal databases), developers would potentially need to build and maintain M×N unique integrations. This approach leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent implementations, and a maintenance burden that scales quadratically with the number of systems and models.6\\n\\nMCP addresses this by transforming the integration landscape into an “M+N problem”.6 Tool creators build ‘N’ MCP servers (one for each system they want to expose), and application developers build or utilize ‘M’ MCP clients (one for each AI application or host environment). The total integration effort becomes additive (M+N) rather than multiplicative. This standardization allows a single integration to communicate with any system that supports the protocol, significantly reducing developer workload, accelerating the rollout of new AI-powered features, and enhancing overall system compatibility.1 The result is a more scalable, plug-and-play approach to augmenting LLM capabilities.1\\n\\n#### **1.3 Core Components: Hosts, Clients, and Servers**\\n\\nThe MCP architecture is fundamentally based on a client-host-server pattern, typically transported over JSON-RPC 2.0.1 Understanding these components is key to grasping how MCP functions:\\n\\n*   **MCP Host:** This is the primary AI application or environment where the LLM operates. Examples include Anthropic’s Claude Desktop, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot, or custom-built AI agents.6 The host acts as a container or coordinator for one or more MCP client instances. It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of these clients, enforcing security policies (such as permissions and user authorization), and overseeing the integration of the AI model with the context gathered via MCP.7\\n*   **MCP Client:** Residing within the host application, the MCP client manages the communication with MCP servers.6 Each client typically establishes a one-to-one, stateful session with a specific MCP server. Its duties include negotiating protocol versions and capabilities with the server, orchestrating messages, and maintaining security boundaries to ensure, for instance, that one client cannot access resources intended for another.7\\n*   **MCP Server:** An MCP server is a separate process or service that implements the MCP protocol to expose specific functionalities—such as tools, data resources, or predefined prompts—to MCP clients.3 These servers can wrap various external systems, like file systems, web search APIs, database connectors, or proprietary enterprise applications.3 They must adhere to the security constraints and user permissions enforced by the host.7\\n\\nThis distributed architecture allows for modularity and specialization, where servers focus on providing access to specific capabilities, and clients/hosts focus on leveraging those capabilities within the AI application.\\n\\n#### **1.4 Key Primitives: Tools, Resources, and Prompts**\\n\\nMCP defines several key “primitives” that servers can expose to clients. These primitives are the building blocks for interaction between the LLM and the external world 7:\\n\\n*   **Tools:** These are executable functions that an LLM can decide to invoke to perform actions or cause side effects. Examples include calling an external API, writing to a file, or executing a database query.7 Tools are generally considered “model-controlled,” meaning the LLM, based on its reasoning or the user’s request, determines when and how to use a specific tool.\\n*   **Resources:** These represent contextual data that can be loaded and used by the AI application or LLM. Resources are typically “application-controlled,” meaning the client application manages their attachment and lifecycle.7 Examples include the content of a file, logs from a Git repository, or system status information.\\n*   **Prompts:** These are predefined templates or instructions that can be triggered, often by user actions like slash commands or menu selections. Prompts are “user-controlled” and can define reusable interaction patterns, including system instructions, required arguments, and even embed resources.7\\n\\nBy implementing these primitives, server developers enable rich, dynamic, and context-aware interactions, significantly enhancing the capabilities of the connected LLMs.7\\n\\n### **Section 2: Understanding the MCP Architecture and Protocol**\\n\\nDelving deeper into MCP requires an understanding of its technical underpinnings, including the communication flow and the design principles that ensure its flexibility and security.\\n\\n#### **2.1 Communication Flow: From User Query to LLM Response**\\n\\nThe interaction facilitated by MCP typically follows a structured sequence when an LLM needs to access external capabilities 1:\\n\\n1.   **User Query & LLM Determination:** A user interacts with an LLM via an MCP-enabled client (hosted within an application like Claude Desktop or an IDE). The user might ask a question or give a command that requires external information or action (e.g., “What’s the latest price of AAPL stock?”).1 The LLM, often through prompt engineering or its function-calling capabilities, determines that a specific tool should be used (e.g., get_current_stock_price(company=”AAPL”, format=”USD”)).1\\n2.   **Client Initialization & Server Connection:** The host application initializes an MCP client, which then establishes a connection to the relevant MCP server. This connection could be to a local process (e.g., via stdio) or a remote HTTP stream (e.g., Server-Sent Events – SSE).1 An initialize message is typically exchanged to handshake protocol versions and capabilities.1\\n3.   **Tool/Resource Discovery:** The client queries the MCP server to discover available tools and resources. For instance, it might send a {“method”: “tools/list”} request and receive a list of tool definitions.1 This information can be used by the host application to inform the LLM, perhaps by including the tool list in a system prompt or through the model’s function schema.1\\n4.   **Tool Invocation:** The client sends a tools/call request (a JSON-RPC 2.0 message) to the MCP server, specifying the chosen tool name and its parameters.1 For example:\\n\\n{\\n\\n “jsonrpc”: “2.0”,\\n\\n “method”: “tools/call”,\\n\\n “params”: {\\n\\n “tool_name”: “get_current_stock_price”,\\n\\n “inputs”: {\\n\\n “company”: “AAPL”,\\n\\n “format”: “USD”\\n\\n }\\n\\n },\\n\\n “id”: “request-123”\\n\\n}\\n\\n5.   **Server Execution & Result Return:** The MCP server receives the request, executes the specified tool with the provided inputs (e.g., calls a stock API), and returns the result to the client.3\\n6.   **Result Integration & LLM Response:** The MCP client receives the tool’s output. The host application then integrates this result back into the LLM’s context. A common pattern is to inject the result into the conversation (e.g., as a system message like “Result of get_current_stock_price:…”) and allow the model to continue processing and formulate a response to the user (e.g., “The current stock price of AAPL is $173.22 (USD)”).1\\n\\nThis structured flow ensures that LLMs can reliably access and utilize external functionalities in a standardized manner.\\n\\n#### **2.2 Protocol Specifications: JSON-RPC, Transports, and Security**\\n\\nMCP is built upon established technologies to ensure robustness and interoperability:\\n\\n*   **JSON-RPC 2.0:** At its core, MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for its messaging protocol.1 This lightweight remote procedure call protocol is well-suited for the types of interactions MCP facilitates, defining the structure for requests (method, params, id) and responses. The authors of MCP deliberately reused message-flow ideas from the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which also leverages JSON-RPC.2\\n*   **Transport Mechanisms:** MCP is designed to be transport-agnostic, supporting various communication channels to accommodate different deployment scenarios.10\\n\\n*   **Stdio (Standard Input/Output):** Often used for local MCP servers, where the client and server processes communicate via their standard input and output streams. This is common for tools running on a developer’s machine.1\\n*   **HTTP Streaming (SSE – Server-Sent Events):** Used for remote MCP servers, allowing for persistent, real-time, two-way communication.1 The MCP Java SDK, for instance, supports Servlet-based, WebFlux, and WebMVC SSE transports.10 VS Code also supports SSE and streamable HTTP, falling back to SSE if HTTP is not supported by the server.11\\n*   **Security Considerations:** Security is a critical aspect of MCP. The protocol itself aims to enable secure connections, and implementations often incorporate further security measures.1\\n\\n*   **Authentication:** MCP supports OAuth-based authentication, providing a standardized way for servers to verify client identities and for users to grant permissions.1 For example, the MCP Toolbox for Databases supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).13 Specific server configurations might also involve API keys passed via environment variables or secure input prompts.3\\n*   **Access Controls & Permissions:** The host process plays a role in managing security policies, including permissions and user authorization.7 When configuring servers like the file system server, explicit path allowances (–allow-paths) are used to restrict access.3\\n*   **Secure Connections:** The protocol specifications include provisions for secure, two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered tools.2\\n\\nWhile MCP provides a framework for secure interactions, the ultimate responsibility for robust security often lies in the careful implementation and configuration of both clients and servers, as well as the surrounding infrastructure.14\\n\\n#### **2.3 The “M+N” Advantage in Practice**\\n\\nThe shift from an M×N integration complexity to an M+N model is not merely theoretical; it has profound practical implications for the AI development ecosystem. Consider a scenario where an enterprise wishes to empower multiple AI agents—perhaps one for customer service, another for internal knowledge retrieval, and a third for developer assistance—with access to a suite of common enterprise systems like a CRM, a document management system, and a project tracking tool.\\n\\nWithout MCP, each of the three agents would require custom-coded integrations for each of the three enterprise systems, resulting in 3 × 3 = 9 distinct integration points. Each would need to handle authentication, data mapping, and error handling specific to that particular agent-system pair. If a new AI agent is introduced or a new enterprise system needs to be connected, the number of integrations grows rapidly, consuming significant development resources and increasing the risk of inconsistencies.\\n\\nWith MCP, the enterprise systems would each expose an MCP server (N servers, so 3 in this case). Each AI agent would incorporate an MCP client (M clients, also 3 here). The total number of “types” of components to build or configure becomes M + N = 3 + 3 = 6. More importantly, once an MCP server for the CRM is built, _any_ MCP-compliant AI agent can connect to it without requiring new CRM-specific integration code within the agent. Similarly, once an AI agent is MCP-client-enabled, it can potentially connect to _any_ available MCP server. This dramatically reduces redundant work. If the API of the project tracking tool changes, only its MCP server needs to be updated, and all connected agents benefit without individual modifications. This modularity and reusability are at the heart of MCP’s practical advantage, fostering a more agile and scalable AI development environment.5\\n\\n### **Section 3: Getting Started: Setting Up Your MCP Environment**\\n\\nTo practically engage with MCP, developers need to understand how to set up clients, connect to servers, and configure basic interactions. This section provides a guide to these initial steps.\\n\\n#### **3.1 Choosing and Installing MCP SDKs**\\n\\nSoftware Development Kits (SDKs) are crucial for simplifying the development of both MCP clients and servers. They abstract away many of the low-level protocol complexities, such as JSON-RPC message formatting, session management, and transport handling, allowing developers to focus on the core logic of their tools or AI applications.9\\n\\nSeveral SDKs are available for popular programming languages:\\n\\n*   **TypeScript/JavaScript SDK:** Widely used, especially for Node.js-based servers and web applications.11 Many example servers, like @anthropic-ai/mcp-fs and @anthropic-ai/mcp-brave, are NPM packages, implying a strong JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.3\\n*   **Python SDK:** Python’s prevalence in AI makes its MCP SDK a popular choice.11 The mcp[cli] package suggests command-line tooling and library support in Python.16\\n*   **Java SDK:** Contributed significantly by the Spring team, the MCP Java SDK provides a robust implementation for enterprise applications.3 It features a layered architecture including Client/Server, Session, and Transport layers. Spring AI further extends this with Spring Boot starters for easier integration.10\\n*   **Go (Golang) SDK:** The mark3labs/mcp-go library is a notable Go implementation aiming for a complete, high-level, and easy-to-use interface for building MCP servers.9 It simplifies server creation, tool/resource/prompt definition, and handles protocol compliance.\\n*   **Other SDKs:** C# and Kotlin SDKs are also available, broadening the options for developers.11\\n\\nWhen starting a new MCP project, developers should select an SDK that aligns with their preferred programming language and project requirements. The official MCP documentation and community resources like GitHub are the best places to find the latest information on available SDKs and their capabilities.4\\n\\n#### **3.2 Choosing an MCP Client (Host Application)**\\n\\nAn MCP Client, typically part of a larger Host Application, is the LLM’s gateway to MCP servers. Several options exist:\\n\\n*   **Claude Desktop:** Anthropic’s desktop application for their Claude models often serves as a reference MCP Host.3 It’s frequently used in tutorials for connecting to local MCP servers, such as file system or web search servers.3\\n*   **Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with GitHub Copilot Chat:** VS Code has integrated MCP support, allowing GitHub Copilot Chat (in agent mode) to utilize tools exposed by MCP servers.11 This requires enabling the chat.mcp.enabled setting in VS Code.11\\n*   **Other IDE Integrations:** A growing number of IDEs and developer tools are adopting MCP to enhance their AI assistance features. These include Cursor, WinSurf, Zed, Replit, Sourcegraph, and Codeium.2 These platforms act as MCP hosts, enabling their integrated AI features to communicate with various MCP servers.\\n*   **Custom Applications:** Developers are not limited to off-the-shelf clients. Using the available SDKs (e.g., Java, Python, Go), they can build custom applications that act as MCP hosts and embed MCP client functionality tailored to specific needs.3\\n\\nThe choice of client often depends on the user’s existing workflow (e.g., using a specific IDE) or the desire to build a bespoke AI application.\\n\\n#### **3.3 Connecting to an Existing MCP Server: A Practical Walkthrough**\\n\\nConnecting a client to an existing MCP server is a common starting point. The following walkthrough demonstrates connecting Claude Desktop to a local File System Server, based on instructions found in multiple sources 3:\\n\\n1.   **Install an MCP Client (Host Application):**\\n\\n*   Download and install Claude Desktop from the official source (e.g., claude.ai/desktop).3\\n\\n1.   **Configure the MCP File System Server:**\\n\\n*   **Prerequisite:** Ensure Node.js is installed on your system, as many reference MCP servers are distributed as NPM packages.3\\n*   **Create/Edit Configuration File:** Claude Desktop uses a JSON configuration file to define which MCP servers to connect to.\\n\\n*   On macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.3\\n*   On Windows: %APPDATA%\\\\Claude\\\\claude_desktop_config.json.3 Create this file if it doesn’t exist.\\n*   **Add Server Configuration:** Add the following JSON structure to the file, replacing /your/allowed/path with the actual directory path you want Claude to access (e.g., your Downloads or a specific project folder):\\n\\nJSON\\n\\n{\\n\\n “mcp_servers”: [\\n\\n “npx @anthropic-ai/mcp-fs –allow-paths=/your/allowed/path”\\n\\n ]\\n\\n}\\n\\nThe command npx @anthropic-ai/mcp-fs –allow-paths=/your/allowed/path instructs Claude Desktop to run the file system MCP server, allowing it to operate only within the specified directory for security reasons.3\\n\\n1.   **Launch/Restart the Client Application:**\\n\\n*   Start or restart Claude Desktop. If the configuration is correct, the application should attempt to connect to the specified MCP server.\\n*   Look for visual indicators within Claude Desktop that signify an active MCP connection. These might include a small “plug” icon or a “hammer” icon, which usually lists the available tools from connected servers.3\\n\\n1.   **Verify Available Tools:**\\n\\n*   Once \\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 4: MCP -

In [Part 1](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/introduction-to-model-context-protocol/ \"Part 1\") , we explored the fundamental challenge MCP addresses: the complex web of custom integrations needed to connect diverse AI applications with the ever-growing universe of external tools and data sources – the “M x N” problem. We introduced MCP as a promising solution, an open standard designed to simplify this landscape into a more manageable “M + N” scenario by providing a universal communication layer. Often described as a “USB-C port for AI,” MCP aims to standardize how AI models plug into the context they need, fostering a more interoperable ecosystem.\\n\\nThis post, Part 2, shifts gears from the ‘why’ to the ‘how’. We’ll dive deep into the technical architecture that powers MCP, dissecting the protocol’s mechanics piece by piece. Understanding these underlying components is crucial for developers aiming to build robust MCP servers or integrate MCP clients into their AI applications. We will examine how MCP structures its messages, the data formats and transports it uses, and how it represents capabilities like tools and resources. By the end, you’ll have a detailed understanding of MCP’s architecture, preparing you for the step-by-step server implementation in Part 3.\\n\\nCommunication Foundation: JSON-RPC 2.0[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#communication-foundation-json-rpc-20)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we’ve set the stage, let’s begin our technical exploration by examining the very foundation of MCP communication: how do the different components – the Host application, the MCP Client, and the MCP Server – actually talk to each other? To ensure consistency and interoperability across the diverse ecosystem of AI applications and tools, MCP relies on a well-established standard for structuring these conversations. This brings us to the protocol’s core communication mechanism.\\n\\nThe communication between MCP Clients and Servers is built upon the **JSON-RPC 2.0** specification. This choice provides several advantages:\\n\\n*   **Standardization:** It leverages a well-defined, widely implemented, and understood remote procedure call protocol.\\n*   **Simplicity:** JSON-RPC 2.0 defines a relatively straightforward structure for requests, responses, and notifications.\\n*   **Data Format:** It utilizes JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for message serialization, which is human-readable, easily parsed across numerous programming languages, and inherently compatible with web technologies.\\n*   **Proven Foundation:** The protocol explicitly draws inspiration from the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which also successfully employs JSON-RPC to standardize communication between development tools and language servers.\\n\\nBy adopting JSON-RPC, MCP avoids reinventing fundamental RPC mechanisms. This strategic decision likely accelerated the development of MCP SDKs across various languages and lowers the adoption barrier, allowing the protocol’s focus to remain on the specific semantics of AI context exchange.\\n\\nStructured JSON Messages in MCP[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#structured-json-messages-in-mcp)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs discussed above, all MCP communications are built on **structured messages** following the JSON-RPC 2.0 standard. Every message is a JSON object containing specific fields that convey its intent and allow the recipient to understand how to process it. Key fields include:\\n\\n*   **`jsonrpc` (version):** Specifies the protocol version (always `\"2.0\"` for JSON-RPC 2.0). This field ensures both sides interpret the message format the same way.\\n*   **`id` (identifier):** A unique ID for pairing requests with responses. The sender assigns an `id` to each request, and the receiver uses the same `id` in the corresponding response. This can be a number or string; it’s used only for matching responses and is not needed for one-way messages (notifications).\\n*   **`method`:** A String indicating the name of the method to be invoked or the notification type. Examples include `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `$/progress`, or `$/cancelRequest`. This field is **REQUIRED** for both Requests and Notifications.\\n*   **`params` (or `payload`/`data`):** An object (or array) containing data needed to perform the method. This could be inputs to a tool, a resource identifier, or other context. It may be omitted if a method doesn’t require additional data.\\n*   **`result`:** Included in Response messages upon successful method execution. This field contains the value returned by the invoked method. It is **REQUIRED** on success and **MUST NOT** exist if the `error` field is present.\\n*   **`error`:** Included in Response messages when a method invocation fails. This field **MUST** be an Object containing:\\n    *   **`code`:** An Integer indicating the error type that occurred (using standard JSON-RPC error codes or potentially custom codes).\\n    *   **`message`:** A String providing a short description of the error.\\n    *   **`data` (optional):** A primitive or structured value containing additional information about the error. The `error` field is **REQUIRED** on failure and **MUST NOT** exist if the `result` field is present.\\n\\nThese fields make MCP messages self-descriptive and machine-readable. Notably, there is no explicit field for “message type” – instead, the presence or absence of certain fields defines the type. For example, a message with a `method` and no `result` or `error` is a **Request**; a message with `result` or `error` (but no `method`) is a **Response** to a prior request; and a message with a `method` but **no** `id` is treated as a one-way **Notification** (no response expected).\\n\\nMCP Transport Layers and Connection Flows[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#mcp-transport-layers-and-connection-flows)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is **transport-agnostic**, meaning it can operate over any channel capable of carrying JSON text. This flexibility allows MCP to support multiple transport layers—Standard Input/Output (STDIO), HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE), and WebSockets—each suited to specific use cases. Below, we explore these transport mechanisms, their connection flows, message framing, and their respective strengths and limitations.\\n\\n### Transport Layers[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#transport-layers)\\n\\nMCP supports three primary transport layers, each designed to balance latency, infrastructure compatibility, and interactivity:\\n\\n*   **Standard Input/Output (STDIO):**  \\n    STDIO leverages a process’s stdin and stdout streams for communication, typically when the MCP server runs as a local subprocess of the host application (similar to Language Server Protocol implementations).\\n    \\n    *   **Pros:** Extremely low latency (microseconds) due to no network overhead, simple setup for local plugins, and inherits OS-level security (only the user’s process can access it).\\n    *   **Cons:** Limited to local connections (cannot easily connect to remote servers), and requires the host to manage the server process lifecycle.\\n    *   **Use Cases:** Local integrations, such as an AI assistant spawning a tool-access server on the same machine to securely access the local filesystem or databases.\\n*   **HTTP + Server-Sent Events (SSE):**  \\n    This transport uses standard HTTP requests for client-to-server communication and a long-lived SSE connection for server-to-client streaming. It’s ideal for remote servers and one-way data streaming.\\n    \\n    *   **Pros:** Compatible with existing web infrastructure (e.g., proxies), supports real-time incremental results via server push, and works with web clients that cannot initiate arbitrary sockets.\\n    *   **Cons:** SSE is unidirectional (server-to-client only), requiring separate HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication. Managing dual channels (HTTP + SSE) adds complexity, and long-lived SSE connections may require special handling with load balancers or proxies.\\n    *   **Use Cases:** Cloud-based or remote MCP servers, such as an AI assistant connecting to a cloud data source that streams results as they become available (e.g., in a browser environment).\\n    *   **Note:** MCP is exploring _Streamable HTTP_ to unify HTTP+SSE into a single connection with streaming capabilities. As of the 2025 spec, SSE remains the primary HTTP streaming method, but future iterations may enhance this.\\n*   **WebSockets:**  \\n    WebSockets provide a persistent, full-duplex connection for bidirectional communication with low latency (milliseconds).\\n    \\n    *   **Pros:** True real-time two-way communication, single connection management, and efficient for interactive or high-frequency message exchanges.\\n    *   **Cons:** Requires WebSocket support, which may be restricted in some corporate networks, and involves slight overhead during connection handshaking.\\n    *   **Use Cases:** Interactive scenarios or long-running connections, such as an AI-powered IDE continuously interacting with a tool server for spontaneous notifications and commands.\\n\\nMCP’s JSON message format remains consistent across all transports, tunneled through the chosen mechanism. The choice of transport depends on deployment needs: STDIO for local plugins, HTTP+SSE for web-friendly streaming, and WebSockets for full-duplex interactivity.\\n\\n### Connection Flows and Message Framing[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#connection-flows-and-message-framing)\\n\\nEach transport defines how MCP messages are exchanged and framed (delimited) on the wire, ensuring reliable, ordered delivery of JSON-RPC messages. Below is an overview of the connection flows and framing for each transport:\\n\\n*   **STDIO Transport:**\\n    \\n    *   **Connection Flow:** Used when the MCP client (within the host application) and server run on the same machine. The host application launches the server as a subprocess (e.g., npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/root). Communication occurs over the server’s stdin and stdout pipes, effectively forming the “connection.”\\n    *   **Message Framing:** JSON-RPC messages are exchanged over stdin/stdout. Simple implementations may separate messages with newlines, but robust systems may use explicit framing, prefixing each JSON message with headers like Content-Length: NNN\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n, followed by the JSON payload. This ensures accurate message delimitation, especially for large messages.\\n    *   **Use Case Example:** A local tool server handling file system operations or Git commands, where the host manages the server’s lifecycle.\\n*   **HTTP + SSE Transport:**\\n    \\n    *   **Connection Flow:** Supports communication between clients and servers on the same or different machines. The MCP server runs independently, exposing an HTTP endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:3000/mcp). The client initiates a standard HTTP connection, and the server uses SSE to push JSON-RPC messages asynchronously over a persistent connection.\\n    *   **Message Framing:** SSE uses a text-based framing protocol. Messages are sent as “events” with fields like event: message\\\\_type (optional), data: json\\\\_payload, id: (optional), and retry: (optional). Each field is a line, and events are terminated by a double newline (\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n). MCP JSON-RPC messages are encoded as JSON strings within the data: field of an SSE event. Clients send commands via separate HTTP POST requests to the server’s endpoint (e.g., /mcp).\\n    *   **Use Case Example:** A web-based client accessing a remote MCP server for shared services or APIs, with the server streaming results back.\\n*   **WebSockets Transport:**\\n    \\n    *   **Connection Flow:** A single WebSocket connection is established, enabling full-duplex communication. The client connects to the server’s WebSocket endpoint, and both parties can send messages at any time after the handshake.\\n    *   **Message Framing:** WebSockets naturally carry JSON text frames bidirectionally. Each MCP JSON-RPC message is sent as a single WebSocket frame, with no additional framing required beyond the WebSocket protocol’s built-in message boundaries.\\n    *   **Use Case Example:** An interactive AI IDE sending commands and receiving spontaneous server notifications over a single, low-latency connection.\\n\\n### Transport Abstraction[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#transport-abstraction)\\n\\nMCP’s design ensures the higher-level protocol (JSON-RPC + capabilities) remains consistent across transports. Developers can switch transports—e.g., from STDIO during development to WebSockets in production—without altering the core logic of their MCP client or server. SDKs or transport handlers abstract away the details of framing and connection management, allowing seamless transitions between transports based on deployment requirements.\\n\\nCapabilities in MCP: Tools, Resources, and Prompts[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#capabilities-in-mcp-tools-resources-and-prompts)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we understand the communication foundation and how messages are transmitted we can focus on how communication actually occurs. First..How does an AI client know what capabilities a server provides? MCP includes a discovery mechanism. When a connection is first established, the client and server perform a **handshake** (initialization sequence) where they exchange supported features. The client sends an `initialize` request identifying the MCP protocol version it speaks and perhaps its own capabilities or preferences. The server responds with an acknowledgment that includes its available capability types (whether it has resources, tools, and/or prompts, and possibly other info like server name/version). This exchange ensures both sides know what the other supports (for example, a server might declare it supports the “resources” and “tools” features, but not “prompts”). After this, the client sends an `initialized` notification to finalize the handshake.\\n\\nsequenceDiagram title MCP Session Initialization participant Client participant Server Note over Client,Server: MCP = Message Control Protocol Client-\\\\>Server: initialize Request  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"method\": \"initialize\", \"params\": {...}} activate Server alt Success Server--\\\\>Client: initialize Response  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"result\": {\"capabilities\": {...}, \"serverInfo\": {...}}} else Failure Server--\\\\>Client: Error Response  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"error\": {\"code\": -32000, \"message\": \"Server not ready\"}} end deactivate Server Client-\\\\>Server: initialized Notification  \\n{\"method\": \"initialized\", \"params\": {}} Note right of Server: MCP Session is now established\\n\\nOnce initialized, the client can query the server for specific capability details. MCP defines the below **standard JSON-RPC methods** for discovering and using capabilities:\\n\\n*   **`resources/list`:** Discovers what resources the server offers. The server returns a list of resource descriptors (each typically includes a `uri`, a human-friendly `name` or description, and maybe a MIME type or other metadata).\\n    \\n*   **`resources/read`:** Requests the content of a specific resource identified by URI. The server returns the resource data (text content, or binary data encoded in base64, along with metadata like MIME type).\\n    \\n*   **`tools/list`:** Retrieves the list of available tools (actions) the server can perform. The response is an array of tools, each with a `name`, a description of what it does, and an `inputSchema` (often a JSON Schema or similar) describing the expected parameters for that tool. The schema helps the client (and ultimately the AI) understand how to call the tool correctly (what inputs are required).\\n    \\n*   **`tools/call`:** Invokes a named tool with provided parameters. The server executes the action and returns the result. The result format depends on the tool (could be any JSON data structure defined by that tool’s contract) or returns an error if something went wrong during execution.\\n    \\n*   **`prompts/list` and `prompts/get`:** Similarly, list available prompt templates and retrieve the content of a selected prompt.\\n    \\n\\nUsing these standardized methods, an MCP client can systematically explore what a server can do. For instance, right after initialization, a client might call `tools/list` and `resources/list` to get a full inventory of capabilities. The **capabilities object** exchanged in the handshake is high-level (just indicates categories supported), while these list methods provide the detailed inventory of each category. This two-step discovery (handshake negotiation, then detailed listing) allows MCP to remain **extensible** – new categories of capabilities or new features can be introduced in future versions, and clients/servers will negotiate if they support them.\\n\\nConnection Establishment and Capability Discovery[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#connection-establishment-and-capability-discovery)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEstablishing a connection in MCP involves both setting up the transport and performing a protocol handshake. At the transport level, this means connecting via STDIO, HTTP+SSE, or WebSocket as discussed earlier (e.g. launching a subprocess for STDIO, or opening an HTTP connection for SSE events). Once the low-level connection is open, the **MCP handshake** occurs at the JSON-RPC level:\\n\\n1.  **Client Initialization:** The client (host application) sends an `initialize` JSON-RPC **request** to the server. This message typically includes parameters such as the MCP protocol version and the client’s own supported features or preferences. For example, the client might send the version and indicate it’s ready to handle certain server capabilities. It may also specify a list of “roots” or a scope for resources (to limit what the server should have access to, e.g., only a certain directory). The `initialize` request carries an `id` since the client expects the server to reply. A sample initialization request is below\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 1,\\n  \"method\": \"initialize\",\\n  \"params\": {\\n    \"processId\": null,\\n    \"clientInfo\": {\\n      \"name\": \"ExampleHostApp\",\\n      \"version\": \"1.2.0\"\\n    },\\n    \"capabilities\": {\\n     },\\n    \"trace\": \"off\",\\n    \"rootUri\": null,\\n    \"workspaceFolders\": null\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\n2.  **Server Response (Capabilities Ack):** The server responds to `initialize` with a JSON-RPC **response** containing its details. In the response’s `result`, the server includes information such as:\\n    \\n    *   **`capabilities`:** The capability types it supports (e.g. `{ \"resources\": {}, \"tools\": {} }` to advertise that it provides resources and tools).\\n    *   **`serverName` and `serverVersion`:** Identification of the server (helpful for logging or UI).\\n    *   Optionally, any other info or negotiated settings (for example, some servers might send a `sessionId` or accepted protocol version if negotiation was needed).\\n    \\n    The server’s response confirms the protocol version (usually it will mirror what the client requested if compatible) and lists what features it can offer. This capability negotiation allows the client to adjust its behavior if needed and is designed for backwards-compatibility as MCP evolves. A sample initialization response is below.\\n    \\n    ```json\\n    {\\n      \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n      \"id\": 1,\\n      \"result\": {\\n        \"capabilities\": {\\n          \"tools\": {\\n            \"supported\": true\\n          },\\n          \"resources\": {\\n            \"supported\": true\\n          },\\n          \"prompts\": {\\n            \"supported\": false\\n          }\\n        },\\n        \"serverInfo\": {\\n          \"name\": \"SampleMCPServer\",\\n          \"version\": \"0.1.0\"\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n    \\n    copy\\n    \\n3.  **Client Acknowledgment:** After receiving a successful initialize result, the client sends an `initialized` **notification** (a JSON-RPC message with a `method` but no `id`) to signal that it received the server’s capabilities and that the connection is fully established. This tells the server that the client is ready and any startup procedures can be considered done. There is no response to a notification.\\n    \\n\\nAt this point, the MCP session is live and ready for use. The next step is usually **capability discovery**: the client will call the listing methods to get available resources, tools, or prompts. This can be done immediately after initialization, or later on demand when the AI needs something. It’s common for a client to do it upfront so that an AI agent can be aware of what’s available in its context.\\n\\nLet’s walk through an example of discovering a resource and then using it, to illustrate the message flow and structures. The diagram below illustrates the typical flow for invoking a tool, showing both successful and failed outcomes.\\n\\nsequenceDiagram title MCP Resource Access Sequence participant MCP-Client participant MCP-Server Note over MCP-Client,MCP-Server: MCP Session already established MCP-Client-\\\\>MCP-Server: resources/list Request  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"method\": \"resources/list\", \"params\": {}} activate MCP-Server alt Success MCP-Server--\\\\>MCP-Client: resources/list Response  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"result\": {\"resources\": \\\\[\"demo://greeting.txt\", \"demo://info.txt\"\\\\]}} else Failure MCP-Server--\\\\>MCP-Client: resources/list Error Response  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"error\": {\"code\": -32600, \"message\": \"Invalid request\"}} end deactivate MCP-Server Note left of MCP-Client: Client processes resource list  \\nand identifies needed URI MCP-Client-\\\\>MCP-Server: resources/read Request  \\n{\"id\": 2, \"method\": \"resources/read\", \"params\": {\"uri\":\"demo://greeting.txt\"}} activate MCP-Server alt Success MCP-Server--\\\\>MCP-Client: resources/read Response  \\n{\"id\": 2, \"result\": {\"contents\": \"Hello, World!\"}} else Failure MCP-Server--\\\\>MCP-Client: resources/read Error Response  \\n{\"id\": 2, \"error\": {\"code\": -32602, \"message\": \"Resource not found\"}} end deactivate MCP-Server Note left of MCP-Client: Client processes resource content\\n\\n**Example – Listing and Reading a Resource:** Suppose the MCP server provides access to a simple resource (say, a text file). After the handshake, the client can ask for a list of resources:\\n\\n```json\\n// Client -> Server: discover available resources\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 1,\\n  \"method\": \"resources/list\",\\n  \"params\": {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nThis is a request for the server’s resource inventory. The `params` are empty here because no additional data is needed to list everything. The server would reply with a JSON-RPC response containing a list of resources:\\n\\n```json\\n// Server -> Client: list of resources (result of resources/list)\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 1,\\n  \"result\": {\\n    \"resources\": [\\n      {\\n        \"uri\": \"demo://greeting.txt\",\\n        \"name\": \"Greeting File\",\\n        \"description\": \"A friendly greeting text file\",\\n        \"mimeType\": \"text/plain\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nIn this fictional example, the server has one resource (`greeting.txt`) identified by the URI `demo://greeting.txt`. It provides a name and description for the resource, and indicates the MIME type is plain text. (In a real scenario, there could be many resources listed. The URI scheme `demo://` here is arbitrary; some servers might use file paths or other URI schemes like `file://` or custom scheme names.)\\n\\nNow that the client knows a resource exists, the AI (or user) can decide to retrieve it. To get the content of `demo://greeting.txt`, the client sends a `resources/read` request:\\n\\n```json\\n// Client -> Server: request to read a specific resource\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 2,\\n  \"method\": \"resources/read\",\\n  \"params\": { \"uri\": \"demo://greeting.txt\" }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nThis request includes the `uri` of the desired resource as a parameter. The server will attempt to read that resource and respond. If successful, it returns a `result` containing the content:\\n\\n```json\\n// Server -> Client: content of the resource (result of resources/read)\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 2,\\n  \"result\": {\\n    \"contents\": [\\n      {\\n        \"uri\": \"demo://greeting.txt\",\\n        \"text\": \"Hello from MCP!\",\\n        \"mimeType\": \"text/plain\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nHere, the server returned the content of the file: the text `\"Hello from MCP!\"` as plain text. We see that the result wraps the data in a `contents` array – this is an MCP convention since a resource could be multi-part or might return multiple chunks (but in this simple case it’s just one text blob). The `uri` is echoed back to clarify what this content corresponds to (useful if batched) and the MIME type is included as metadata.\\n\\nIf the resource cannot be found or accessed, the server would instead return an error. For example, if the client requested a URI that doesn’t exist:\\n\\n```json\\n// Server -> Client: error response (resource not found)\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 2,\\n  \"error\": {\\n    \"code\": 404,\\n    \"message\": \"Resource not found\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nThis indicates the request failed. The error object contains a numeric `code` and a `message` explaining the failure. In this case we used an HTTP-style `404` code for clarity, but MCP doesn’t mandate specific codes beyond the JSON-RPC standard ones. Some implementations use JSON-RPC’s predefined error codes or domain-specific codes. The key is that an error response always has the `error` field instead of `result`, and the original request `id` so the client knows which call failed.\\n\\nThrough this discovery sequence, the client learned what resources are\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 5: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) — A Complete Tutorial ---\\nURL: https://medium.com/@nimritakoul01/the-model-context-protocol-mcp-a-complete-tutorial-a3abe8a7f4ef\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nAn MCP server can provide access to databases, CRMs like Salesforce, local file systems, and version control systems like Git.

Find the [complete official documentation.](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp) At present, MCP is fully implemented as [Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) and [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk).\\n\\n[Mahesh Murag](https://x.com/MaheshMurag) delivered a great workshop on “[Building Agents with Model Context Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQmXtrmQ5Zg)” during AI Engineer Summit.\\n\\n# Context is the key\\n\\nThe basic capabilities of a Generative AI model depend on its pretraining details, the training data, and the model architecture. To make these pretrained models perform better and improve their relevance and coherence to your task, you must provide a good context to it.\\n\\nHere context refers to the information the model uses to generate relevant and coherent responses. Context determines how the model understands and continues a conversation, completes a text, or generates an image.\\n\\nContext can be provided in different ways, depending on the type of model and task:\\n\\n1. Text-Based Models (e.g., GPT, DeepSeek, LLaMA) receive their context through:\\n\\n- Prompt Context: The input text or query that guides the model’s response.\\n- Token Window: The number of tokens the model can “remember” at a time (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo can handle ~128K tokens).\\n- Conversation History: In chatbots, previous exchanges help maintain context in multi-turn dialogues.\\n- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Context from external documents retrieved dynamically to improve responses.\\n\\n2. Image and Multimodal Models (e.g., DALL·E, Gemini) receive their context through:\\n\\n- Text Descriptions: The prompt guides image generation.\\n- Visual Context: If an image is provided, the model analyzes its content before generating new elements.\\n- Cross-Modal Context: When combining text and images, models interpret both to generate meaningful outputs.\\n\\n3. Code Generation Models (e.g., Codex, DeepSeek-Coder) receive their context through:\\n\\n- Previous Code Blocks: Context includes existing code, function names, and comments.\\n- Programming Language Syntax: The model understands language-specific patterns.\\n- External Documentation: Some models use APIs or docs for more accurate suggestions.\\n\\n4. Speech and Audio Models (e.g., Whisper, AudioPaLM) receive their context through:\\n\\n- Audio Segments: Prior speech or music informs the next generated part.\\n- Linguistic and Acoustic Features: Tone, speed, and intonation influence transcription and generation.\\n\\nIn short, context is the key factor that enables generative AI to produce relevant and coherent outputs. The better the context management, the better the AI’s performance.\\n\\n## Over time the AI models can auto fetch data to act as context. This is especially true of AI Agents which are the systems that use generative AI models at their core. This means the AI Agents have to search for data sources, request the sources for specific data and so on.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:503/1*IL5MzxudiV7UaMzxvQRY-w.png)\\n\\n<https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents>\\n\\nEach data source (server) is implemented is its own way (for example, as open source packages in another codebase — rather than emitting messages that can be consumed by anyone. Or these can be implemented as JSON RPC for messages) so there is no standard way for an AI model (client) to search for and request for data. (Fragmentation.)\\n\\nBefore MCP, building AI systems often involved:\\n\\n- Custom implementations for each AI application to hook into its required context, leading to a lot of duplicated effort.\\n- Inconsistent prompt logic and different methods for accessing and federating tools and data across different teams and companies.\\n- The “N times M problem” where a large number of client applications needed to interact with a large number of servers and tools, resulting in a complex web of integrations, each requiring specific development work.\\n\\n# Model Context Protocol (MCP) solves this problem of fragmented data access.\\n\\n# The MCP provides a open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources and tools (repositories, business tools, development environments), replacing fragmented integrations with a single protocol. Thus MCP provides fungibility between AI clients and servers.\\n\\nThus MCP provides a standardized way for applications to:\\n\\n- Share contextual information with language models\\n- Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems\\n- Build composable integrations and workflows\\n\\nThe protocol uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 messages to establish communication between:\\n\\n- **Hosts**: LLM applications that initiate connections\\n- **Clients**: Connectors within the host application\\n- **Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities\\n\\nThere are a number of popular AI tools that support MCP, including:\\n\\n- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)\\n- [Windsurf](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf) (Codium)\\n- [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) (VS Code extension)\\n- [Claude desktop](https://claude.ai/download)\\n- [Claude code](https://claude.ai/code)\\n\\nMCP takes some inspiration from the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which standardizes how to add support for programming languages across a whole ecosystem of development tools. In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context and tools into the ecosystem of AI applications.\\n\\n# Architecture of MCP\\n\\nMCP follows a client-host-server architecture where each host can run multiple client instances.\\n\\n- This architecture enables users to integrate AI capabilities across applications while maintaining clear security boundaries and isolating concerns.\\n- Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides a stateful session protocol focused on context exchange and sampling coordination between clients and servers.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:611/1*VR9ny7S6tP8_wtvk2UcYZA.png)\\n\\n<https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/architecture/>\\n\\n## Host\\n\\nThe host process acts as the container and coordinator:\\n\\n- Creates and manages multiple client instances\\n- Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle\\n- Enforces security policies and consent requirements\\n- Handles user authorization decisions\\n- Coordinates AI/LLM integration and sampling\\n- Manages context aggregation across clients\\n\\n## Clients\\n\\nEach client is created by the host and maintains an isolated server connection:\\n\\n- Establishes one stateful session per server\\n- Handles protocol negotiation and capability exchange\\n- Routes protocol messages bidirectionally\\n- Manages subscriptions and notifications\\n- Maintains security boundaries between servers\\n\\nA host application creates and manages multiple clients, with each client having a 1:1 relationship with a particular server.\\n\\n**MCP Clients** are the **AI applications or agents** that want to access external systems, tools, or data sources. Examples include Anthropic’s first-party applications, Curser, Windsurf, and agents like Goose. The key characteristic of an MCP client is its **MCP compatibility**, meaning it is built to communicate using the standardised interfaces defined by the protocol: **prompts, tools, and resources**.\\n\\nOnce an MCP client is compatible, it can connect to **any MCP server with minimal or no additional work**. The client is responsible for **invoking tools, querying for resources, and interpolating prompts**.\\n\\nIn the context of tools, the **language model within the client application** decides when it is best to invoke the tools exposed by the server. For resources, the client application has **control over how the data exposed by the server is used**. Prompts are considered **user-controlled tools invoked by the user through the client application**.\\n\\n## Servers\\n\\nServers provide specialized context and capabilities:\\n\\n- Expose resources, tools and prompts via MCP primitives\\n- Operate independently with focused responsibilities\\n- Request sampling through client interfaces\\n- Must respect security constraints\\n- Can be local processes or remote services\\n\\n**MCP Servers** act as **wrappers or intermediaries** that provide a **standardised way to access various external systems, tools, and data sources**. An MCP server can provide access to databases, CRMs like Salesforce, local file systems, and version control systems like Git. The role of the server builder is to **expose tools, resources, and prompts** in a way that is consumable by any compatible client. Once an MCP server is built, it can be adopted by **any MCP client**, solving the “N times M problem” by reducing the need for individualised integrations. For **tools**, the server defines the available functions and their descriptions, allowing the client’s model to decide when to use them. For **resources**, the server defines and potentially creates or retrieves data that it exposes to the client application. For **prompts**, the server provides predefined templates for common interactions that the client application can trigger on behalf of the user.\\n\\nThe MCP protocol acts as the **communication layer** between these two components, standardising how requests and responses are structured and exchanged. This separation offers several benefits, as it allows:\\n\\n- **Seamless Integration:** Clients can connect to a wide range of servers without needing to know the specifics of each underlying system.\\n- **Reusability:** Server developers can build integrations once and have them accessible to many different client applications.\\n- **Separation of Concerns:** Different teams can focus on building client applications or server integrations independently. For example, an infrastructure team can manage an mCP server for a vector database, which can then be easily used by various AI application development teams.\\n\\nIn essence, the relationship between MCP clients and servers is one of **standardised interaction**, where clients leverage the capabilities exposed by servers through the common language of the MCP protocol, leading to a more efficient and scalable ecosystem for building AI applications and agents.\\n\\n# MCP Features\\n\\n## MCP Server Features\\n\\nMCP Servers provide the fundamental building blocks (Prompts, Resources, Tools) for adding context to language models via MCP. These primitives enable rich interactions between clients, servers, and language models:\\n\\n- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates or instructions that guide language model interactions\\n- **Resources**: Structured data or content that provides additional context to the model\\n- **Tools**: Executable functions that allow models to perform actions or retrieve information\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:675/1*VeOPymHhhXjIKGli9m7Kow.png)\\n\\n<https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/>\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to expose prompts, resources, and tools to clients.\\n\\n**Prompts (Protocol Revision: 2024–11–05)**\\n\\nPrompts allow servers to provide structured messages and instructions for interacting with language models. Clients can discover available prompts, retrieve their contents, and provide arguments to customize them.\\n\\nPrompts are designed to be **user-controlled**, meaning they are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the user being able to explicitly select them for use.\\n\\nTypically, prompts would be triggered through user-initiated commands in the user interface, which allows users to naturally discover and invoke available prompts. For example, as slash commands.\\n\\nServers that support prompts **MUST** declare the `prompts` capability during [initialization](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/lifecycle/#initialization):\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:205/1*cNUtassTZUefjI66L2aTDw.png)\\n\\n<https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/prompts/>\\n\\n**Resources : Protocol Revision: 2024–11–05**\\n\\nResources allow servers to share data that provides context to language models, such as files, database schemas, or application-specific information. Each resource is uniquely identified by a [URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).\\n\\nResources in MCP are designed to be **application-driven**, with host applications determining how to incorporate context based on their needs.\\n\\nFor example, applications could:\\n\\n- Expose resources through UI elements for explicit selection, in a tree or list view\\n- Allow the user to search through and filter available resources\\n- Implement automatic context inclusion, based on heuristics or the AI model’s selection\\n\\nServers that support resources **MUST** declare the `resources` capability:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:239/1*quHMUhy2l2ab5dboPiiCXw.png)\\n\\n<https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/resources/>\\n\\nThe capability supports two optional features:\\n\\n- `subscribe`: whether the client can subscribe to be notified of changes to individual resources.\\n- `listChanged`: whether the server will emit notifications when the list of available resources changes.\\n\\n**Tools — Protocol Revision: 2024–11–05**\\n\\nMCP allows servers to expose tools that can be invoked by language models. Tools enable models to interact with external systems, such as querying databases, calling APIs, or performing computations. Each tool is uniquely identified by a name and includes metadata describing its schema.\\n\\nTools in MCP are designed to be **model-controlled**, meaning that the language model can discover and invoke tools automatically based on its contextual understanding and the user’s prompts. However, implementations are free to expose tools through any interface pattern that suits their needs.\\n\\nServers that support tools **MUST** declare the `tools` capability:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:220/1*_vpQUXGZA_afjIBg9lylqA.png)\\n\\n<https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/tools/>\\n\\n`listChanged` indicates whether the server will emit notifications when the list of available tools changes.\\n\\n## MCP Client Features\\n\\nClients can implement additional features to enrich connected MCP servers: **Roots and Sampling**.\\n\\n**Roots**\\n\\n- **Roots** define the boundaries of **where servers can operate within the filesystem,** allowing them to understand which directories and files they have access to. MCP provides a standardized way for clients to expose filesystem “**roots**” to servers. Servers can request the list of roots from supporting clients and receive notifications when that list changes.\\n\\nA root definition includes:\\n\\n- `uri`: Unique identifier for the root. This **MUST** be a `file://` URI in the current specification.\\n- `name`: Optional human-readable name for display purposes.\\n\\nExample roots for different use cases:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:410/1*Nm65oShIFCWFmwaSLgK3xw.png)\\n\\n<https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/client/roots/>\\n\\n**Sampling (Protocol Revision: 2024–11–05)**\\n\\nMCP provides a standardized way for servers to request LLM sampling (“completions” or “generations”) from language models via clients. This flow allows clients to maintain control over model access, selection, and permissions while enabling servers to leverage AI capabilities — with no server API keys necessary. Servers can request text or image-based interactions and optionally include context from MCP servers in their prompts.\\n\\nSampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors, by enabling LLM calls to occur *nested* inside other MCP server features.\\n\\nImplementations are free to expose sampling through any interface pattern that suits their needs — the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.\\n\\n**Composability**\\n\\n- Composability in MCP highlights that the **distinction between a client and a server is logical rather than physical**. This means that **any application, API, or agent can function as both an MCP client and an MCP server simultaneously**.\\n- This dual role allows for the creation of **layered and chained systems**. A user might interact with a primary agent application (a client), which then communicates with a specialised sub-agent (acting as a server). This sub-agent, in turn, can act as a client and invoke other MCP servers (such as a file system server or a web search server) to fulfil its task.\\n- **Relevance to Agents:** Composability is crucial for building advanced, modular agent architectures. It enables the creation of **hierarchical systems of agents**, where different agents can specialise in specific tasks and delegate sub-tasks to other agents. For instance, an orchestrator agent can receive a high-level goal and then break it down into smaller tasks, delegating these tasks to research agents, coding agents, or fact-checking agents, each operating as an MCP server but also potentially acting as a client to access necessary tools and data. This allows for **building complex workflows and intelligent behaviours by combining the capabilities of multiple specialised agents**. It also allows for **reusing and connecting to agents built by others**, even if they were not initially part of the main agent’s design.\\n\\nIn combination, **sampling and composability** are powerful enablers for advanced AI agents. They allow for:\\n\\n- **Distribution of intelligence** across a multi-agent system, with the client controlling the actual LLM interactions while servers (agents) can request these capabilities as needed through sampling.\\n- The construction of **complex, multi-layered agent systems** where specialised agents can work together by acting as both clients and servers.\\n- **Increased flexibility and modularity** in agent design, as new capabilities (exposed as mCP servers) can be integrated into existing agent workflows.\\n- The potential for **agents to evolve and adapt** by interacting with other agents and services in a composable manner.\\n\\nThese concepts move beyond monolithic agent designs and towards more distributed, collaborative, and adaptable AI systems.\\n\\n## Additional Utilities offered by MCP :\\n\\n- Configuration, Progress tracking, Cancellation, Error reporting, Logging\\n\\n## Security and Trust & Safety\\n\\nMCP enables powerful capabilities through arbitrary data access and code execution paths. With this power comes important security and trust considerations that all implementors must carefully address.\\n\\n## Key Principles of MCP Security, Trust and Safety\\n\\n1. **User Consent and Control:** Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations. They must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken. Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities\\n\\n**2. Data Privacy:** Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers. Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent. User data should be protected with appropriate access controls\\n\\n**3. Tool Safety:** Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate caution. Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool. Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use\\n\\n4. **LLM Sampling Controls:** Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests. Users should control — Whether sampling occurs at all, The actual prompt that will be sent, What results the server can see, The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts\\n\\n## Implementation Guidelines: Implementors of MCP should:\\n\\n1. Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications\\n2. Provide clear documentation of security implications\\n3. Implement appropriate access controls and data protections\\n4. Follow security best practices in their integrations\\n5. Consider privacy implications in their feature designs\\n\\n# MCP Design Principles\\n\\nMCP is built on several key design principles that inform its architecture and implementation:\\n\\n1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**\\n\\n- Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities\\n- Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities\\n- Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead\\n- Clear separation enables maintainable code\\n\\n**2. Servers should be highly composable**\\n\\n- Each server provides focused functionality in isolation\\n- Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly\\n- Shared protocol enables interoperability\\n- Modular design supports extensibility\\n\\n**3. Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor “see into” other servers**\\n\\n- Servers receive only necessary contextual information\\n- Full conversation history stays with the host\\n- Each server connection maintains isolation\\n- Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host\\n- Host process enforces security boundaries\\n\\n**4. Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**\\n\\n- Core protocol provides minimal required functionality\\n- Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed\\n- Servers and clients evolve independently\\n- Protocol designed for future extensibility\\n- Backwards compatibility is maintained\\n\\n## MCP Message Types\\n\\nMCP defines three core message types based on [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):\\n\\n- **Requests**: Bidirectional messages with method and parameters expecting a response\\n- **Responses**: Successful results or errors matching specific request IDs\\n- **Notifications**: One-way messages requiring no response\\n\\nEach message type follows the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification for structure and delivery semantics.\\n\\n## Capability Negotiation System in MCP\\n\\nMCP uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and servers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities determine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.\\n\\n- Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt templates\\n- Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling\\n- Both parties must respect declared capabilities throughout the session\\n- Additional capabilities can be negotiated through extensions to the protocol\\n\\nEach capability unlocks specific protocol features for use during the session. For example:\\n\\n- Implemented [server features](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/) must be advertised in the server’s capabilities\\n- Emitting resource subscription notifications requires the server to declare subscription support\\n- Tool invocation requires the server to declare tool capabilities\\n- [Sampling](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/client/) requires the client to declare support in its capabilities\\n\\nThis capability negotiation ensures clients and servers have a clear understanding of supported functionality while maintaining protocol extensibility.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:409/1*lWACMKbZ49EJO52kOYMkmw.png)\\n\\n<https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/architecture/>\\n\\n# Details of the Base MCP Protocol\\n\\n**Protocol Revision**: 2024–11–05\\n\\nAll messages between MCP clients and servers **MUST** follow the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines three fundamental types of messages:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:675/1*G_62KSVy90g4CnTKFgtESQ.png)\\n\\n<https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/>\\n\\n**Responses** are further sub-categorized as either **successful results** or **errors**. Results can follow any JSON object structure, while errors must include an error code and message at minimum.\\n\\n## Protocol Layers\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol consists of several key components that work together:\\n\\n- **Base Protocol**: Core JSON-RPC message types\\n- **Lifecycle Management**: Connection initialization, capability negotiation, and session control\\n- **Server Features**: Resources, prompts, and tools exposed by servers\\n- **Client Features**: Sampling and root directory lists provided by clients\\n- **Utilities**: Cross-cutting concerns like logging and argument completion\\n\\nAll implementations **MUST** support the base protocol and lifecycle management components. Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the application.\\n\\nThese protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich interactions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to support exactly the features they need.\\n\\n**Life Cycle for client-server connections:**\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a rigorous lifecycle for client-server connections that ensures proper capability negotiation and state management.\\n\\n1. **Initialization**: Capability negotiation and protocol version agreement\\n2. **Operation**: Normal protocol communication\\n3. **Shutdown**: Graceful termination of the connection\\n\\n**Lifecycle Phases:**\\n\\n1. **Initialization:** The initialization phase **MUST** be the first interaction between client and server. During this phase, the client and server:\\n\\n- Establish protocol version compatibility\\n- Exchange and negotiate capabilities\\n- Share implementation details\\n\\nThe client **MUST** initiate this phase by sending an `initialize` request containing:\\n\\n- Protocol version supported\\n- Client capabilities\\n- Client implementation information\\n\\nThe server **MUST** respond with its own capabilities and information.\\n\\nAfter successful initialization, the client **MUST** send an `initialized` notification to indicate it is ready to begin normal operations.The client **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than [pings](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/utilities/ping/) before the server has responded to the `initialize` request. The server **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than [pings](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/utilities/ping/) and [logging](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/server/utilities/logging/) before receiving the `initialized` notification.\\n\\n**2. Version Negotiation:** In the `initialize` request, the client **MUST** send a protocol version it supports. This **SHOULD** be the *latest* version supported by the client. If the server supports the requested protocol version, it **MUST** respond with the same version. Otherwise, the server **MUST** respond with another protocol version it supports. This **SHOULD** be the *latest* version supported by the server. If the client does not support the version in the server’s response, it **SHOULD** disconnect.\\n\\n**3. Capability Negotiation:** Client and server capabilities establish which optional protocol features will be available during the session.\\n\\nKey capabilities include:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:682/1*T3n9oqH9xqniEvX4M_Rx_g.png)\\n\\n<https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/lifecycle/>\\n\\nCapability objects can describe sub-capabilities.\\n\\n**4. Operation:** During the operation phase, the client and server exchange messages according to the negotiated capabilities.\\n\\nBoth parties **SHOULD**:\\n\\n- Respect the negotiated protocol version\\n- Only use capabilities that were successfully negotiated\\n\\n**5. Shutdown:** During the shutdown phase, one side (usually the client) cleanly terminates the protocol connection. No specific shutdown messages are defined — instead, the underlying transport mechanism should be used to signal connection termination:\\n\\n## stdio\\n\\nFor the stdio [transport](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/), the client **SHOULD** initiate shutdown by:\\n\\n1.

In this section, you\\'ll build a fully working MCP server that uses the `sampling/createMessage` protocol method to generate responses from a language model through an MCP client.

These parts allow MCP servers to provide data, functionality, and structured guidance to clients. But what happens when your server needs to make a complex decision or understand context beyond simple rules? That’s where you’ll find sampling pretty helpful.\\n\\nWhat is MCP Sampling?\\n---------------------\\n\\nMCP sampling flips the normal client-server relationship. In typical MCP interactions, the client (like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)) initiates requests to servers (like [Github](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github) or [filesystem](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) integration). Sampling works differently.\\n\\nSampling enables MCP servers to request Large Language Model (LLM) completions from clients. Your server can ask the AI model to:\\n\\n*   Analyze data it has collected\\n*   Make decisions based on context\\n*   Generate structured content in specific formats\\n*   Solve multi-step problems with reasoning\\n\\nThe client (which controls access to the language model) manages these requests, often with human approval at key checkpoints.Thus, MCP sampling enables human feedback to the output created by LLMs, providing seamless workflow between the client and server.\\n\\nThe Complete Sampling Flow\\n--------------------------\\n\\nLet’s walk through exactly how sampling works:\\n\\n1.   Your MCP server sends a `sampling/createMessage` request with prompts, optional system instructions, model preferences, and context requirements.\\n2.   The client (e.g., Claude Desktop) receives this request, validates it, and shows the user what the server wants to ask the LLM. The user can edit, approve, or reject the prompt.\\n3.   If approved, the client sends the prompt to the language model, receives a completion, and shows it to the user. Again, the user can edit, approve, or reject the completion.\\n4.   The client returns the approved completion to the server as a response to the original request.\\n5.   Your server can then use this AI-generated content to continue its operation, possibly making further sampling requests later.\\n\\n![Image 1: An illustration of the MCP Sampling workflow](https://www.mcpevals.io/images/workflow_mcp_sampling.png)\\n\\nThis flow keeps humans in control while allowing servers to use AI capabilities.\\n\\nUnderstanding the Sampling Request Format\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nA complete sampling request in MCP contains several key components. Let’s explore a typical sampling request structure below:\\n\\n```typescript\\n{\\n  messages: [\\n    {\\n      role: \"user\" | \"assistant\",\\n      content: {\\n        type: \"text\" | \"image\" | \"audio\",\\n        text?: string,           // For text content\\n        data?: string,           // Base64 encoded for image/audio\\n        mimeType?: string        // Required for image/audio\\n      }\\n    }\\n    // More messages can be included for conversation context\\n  ],\\n  modelPreferences?: {\\n    hints?: [{\\n      name?: string           // E.g., \"claude-3-sonnet\", \"gpt-4\"\\n    }],\\n    costPriority?: number,    // 0-1 scale (higher = more cost-sensitive)\\n    speedPriority?: number,   // 0-1 scale (higher = faster response preferred)\\n    intelligencePriority?: number  // 0-1 scale (higher = more capable model)\\n  },\\n  systemPrompt?: string,      // Instructions for model behavior\\n  includeContext?: \"none\" | \"thisServer\" | \"allServers\", // MCP context to include\\n  temperature?: number,       // 0-1 scale for randomness (lower = more deterministic)\\n  maxTokens: number,          // Maximum response length\\n  stopSequences?: string[],   // Sequences that end generation early\\n  metadata?: Record<string, unknown> // Additional parameters\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet’s break down the key elements:\\n\\n### Messages\\n\\nThe `messages` array contains the conversation history that will be sent to the LLM. Each message includes a role (`user` or `assistant`) and content (`text`, `image`, or `audio`).\\n\\nFor models like Claude 3, you can include images by adding image content with base64-encoded data.\\n\\n### Model Preferences\\n\\nThe `modelPreferences` object enables your server to influence model selection without specifying an exact model. You can suggest preferred models (e.g., `claude-3-sonnet`) while letting the client make the final choice. The priority values help the client balance between cost, speed, and intelligence when selecting a model.\\n\\n### Including Context\\n\\nThe `includeContext` field brings in additional MCP context:\\n\\n*   `none`: No additional context (default)\\n*   `thisServer`: Include context from the requesting server\\n*   `allServers`: Include context from all connected MCP servers\\n\\nThis helps language models understand the broader environment when responding.\\n\\nThe Response Format\\n-------------------\\n\\nWhen the client returns a response, it follows the below structure:\\n\\n```typescript\\n{\\n  model: string,          // Name of the model used (e.g., \"claude-3-sonnet-20240229\")\\n  stopReason?: \"endTurn\" | \"stopSequence\" | \"maxTokens\" | string, // Why generation ended\\n  role: \"assistant\",      // Always \"assistant\" for LLM responses\\n  content: {\\n    type: \"text\" | \"image\" | \"audio\",\\n    text?: string,        // For text responses\\n    data?: string,        // Base64-encoded for image/audio\\n    mimeType?: string     // Required for image/audio\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis standard format makes it easy to parse and use the LLM’s output in your server logic.\\n\\nBuilding a Server That Uses Sampling\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nIn this section, you\\'ll build a fully working MCP server that uses the `sampling/createMessage` protocol method to generate responses from a language model through an MCP client. The server won’t need any direct LLM API keys. Instead, it asks the client to handle model access, approval, and delivery.\\n\\nIn this project, the server acts like a code review assistant. It sends a simple JavaScript function to the MCP client and requests LLM suggestions for improving it. The sampling is done with the user’s permission and oversight, fulfilling the human-in-the-loop requirement of the protocol.\\n\\n### 1. Create the Project Directory\\n\\nCreate and initialize a new project folder:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ mkdir code-review-server\\n$ cd code-review-server\\n$ npm init -y\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Install Dependencies\\n\\nInstall the MCP SDK and TypeScript-related packages:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk\\n$ npm install -D typescript @types/node\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Configure TypeScript\\n\\nCreate a default TypeScript config file:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npx tsc --init\\n```\\n\\nThen replace the contents of `tsconfig.json` with this minimal setup for MCP:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\\n    \"target\": \"ES2022\",\\n    \"module\": \"Node16\",\\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"Node16\",\\n    \"outDir\": \"./dist\",\\n    \"rootDir\": \"./src\",\\n    \"strict\": true,\\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true\\n  },\\n  \"include\": [\"src/**/*\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Update Scripts in package.json\\n\\nAdd build and start commands so you can run the server easily:\\n\\n```json\\n\"scripts\": {\\n  \"build\": \"tsc\",\\n  \"start\": \"node dist/index.js\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Set Up Project Structure\\n\\nCreate your source folder and entry file:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ mkdir src\\n$ touch src/index.ts\\n```\\n\\n### 6. Implement the Code Reviewer Server\\n\\nPaste the following code into `src/index.ts`. It defines the code to review, constructs a sampling request, and prints the LLM’s suggestion when the client responds.\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { Server } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js\";\\nimport { StdioServerTransport } from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js\";\\nimport {\\n  SubscribeRequestSchema,\\n  CreateMessageRequest,\\n  CreateMessageResultSchema,\\n} from \"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/types.js\";\\n\\nconst server = new Server(\\n  { name: \"code-review-server\", version: \"1.0.0\" },\\n  { capabilities: {} }\\n);\\n\\nconst codeToReview = `function greet(name) {\\n  if (name) {\\n    return \\'Hello, \\' + name;\\n  } else {\\n    return \\'Hello, guest!\\';\\n  }\\n}`;\\n\\nconst requestSampling = async () => {\\n  const request: CreateMessageRequest = {\\n    method: \"sampling/createMessage\",\\n    params: {\\n      messages: [\\n        {\\n          role: \"user\",\\n          content: {\\n            type: \"text\",\\n            text: codeToReview\\n          }\\n        }\\n      ],\\n      systemPrompt: \"You are a senior JavaScript developer. Suggest code improvements.\",\\n      maxTokens: 150,\\n      temperature: 0.4,\\n      includeContext: \"thisServer\"\\n    }\\n  };\\n\\n  try {\\n    const result = await server.request(request, CreateMessageResultSchema);\\n    console.log(\"\\\\\\\\n=== LLM Code Review Suggestion ===\\\\\\\\n\" + result.content?.text + \"\\\\\\\\n=================================\\\\\\\\n\");\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    console.error(\"Sampling request failed:\", error);\\n  }\\n};\\n\\nserver.setRequestHandler(SubscribeRequestSchema, async () => {\\n  await requestSampling();\\n  return {};\\n});\\n\\nconst transport = new StdioServerTransport();\\nserver.connect(transport);\\nconsole.error(\"Code Review Sampling Server is running...\");\\n```\\n\\n### 7. Build and Run the Server\\n\\nFirst, compile the TypeScript code:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm run build\\n```\\n\\nThen start the server:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ npm start\\n```\\n\\nWhen your client sends a `subscribe` message, the server immediately sends the sample code to be reviewed by the LLM through the client.\\n\\n### 8. Sample Request and Response\\n\\nHere’s the actual request format sent to the client:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"method\": \"sampling/createMessage\",\\n  \"params\": {\\n    \"messages\": [\\n      {\\n        \"role\": \"user\",\\n        \"content\": {\\n          \"type\": \"text\",\\n          \"text\": \"function greet(name) { if (name) { return \\'Hello, \\' + name; } else { return \\'Hello, guest!\\'; } }\"\\n        }\\n      }\\n    ],\\n    \"systemPrompt\": \"You are a senior JavaScript developer. Suggest code improvements.\",\\n    \"includeContext\": \"thisServer\",\\n    \"maxTokens\": 150,\\n    \"temperature\": 0.4\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nA valid client will return something like:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4\",\\n  \"stopReason\": \"endTurn\",\\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\\n  \"content\": {\\n    \"type\": \"text\",\\n    \"text\": \"function greet(name = \\'guest\\') { return `Hello, ${name}!`; }\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### User Interaction Flow\\n\\nThe user controls the flow at the client side. Here\\'s what happens:\\n\\n1.   **Server sends request:** The server sends a structured request to the client.\\n2.   **Client reviews prompt:** The client presents the request to the user.\\n3.   **User approves or edits:** The user can edit or reject the prompt before sending.\\n4.   **Client contacts LLM:** If approved, the client sends it to the LLM.\\n5.   **LLM responds:** The client receives the completion.\\n6.   **User reviews again:** The client shows the output to the user for final review.\\n7.   **Final result:** The approved result is returned to the server.\\n\\nMCP sampling enables a secure, explainable, and user-controlled interaction between your server and powerful LLMs. With just a few lines of code, you’ve:\\n\\n*   Triggered LLM responses without managing API keys\\n*   Ensured the user can inspect, edit, or reject prompts and responses\\n*   Built a real agentic pattern with user-supervised AI\\n\\nYou can now build intelligent agents that operate responsibly under user direction—exactly what MCP was designed to support.\\n\\nIntegration with Other MCP Features\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nSampling works best when combined with other MCP features. You can use resources to read data, then use sampling to analyze it. You can use sampling to decide what tool to call and with what parameters. You can also allow users to trigger workflow that include sampling steps via prompts.\\n\\nFor example, a Git MCP server might read commit history via resources, use sampling to analyze patterns and suggest improvements. Then, it can use tools to apply those suggestions if approved.\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nMCP Sampling changes how we build smart applications. It enables servers to request AI completions through clients. As a result, sampling creates a new tool that combines server-side functionality with AI reasoning capabilities.\\n\\nAs MCP protocol continues to grow, sampling will likely gain new capabilities such as::\\n\\n*   Better streaming support for real-time responses\\n*   More detailed model control settings\\n*   Better context handling for larger documents\\n*   More multimodal capabilities (audio, video)\\n\\nAs you develop MCP applications, think about where sampling could make your server smarter. It doesn’t matter whether you’re building code analyzers, data pipelines, or decision support tools, sampling opens new ways to create truly intelligent integrations.\\n\\n© 2025 mcpevals.io.

MCP acts as a universal interface — akin to a “USB-C” for AI — offering a standardized, open framework for AI agents to connect and communicate with external resources.\\n\\nAt the core of this system are **MCP servers** — software components that securely expose specific tools, data sources, or services via the MCP protocol. These servers can be deployed locally or hosted remotely and serve as bridges between AI models and the outside world. From local files to cloud APIs, MCP servers allow AI agents to interact with virtually any resource.\\n\\nA rapidly growing ecosystem of **publicly available MCP servers** has emerged, driven by the open-source community. These servers offer pre-built integrations that developers can plug into, allowing them to accelerate development, prototype quickly, and unlock new capabilities without building every connection from scratch.\\n\\nIn this article, we’ll explore what MCP servers are, the benefits of using public ones, and walk through hands-on examples with FastAPI and GitHub MCP servers. We’ll also guide you through building your own FastAPI MCP server, and touch on critical security considerations.\\n\\n# Understanding the MCP Ecosystem\\n\\nHere are the key components in an MCP-powered system:\\n\\n*For a security-focused technical breakdown of MCP architecture, refer to* [*GitGuardian’s article*](https://blog.gitguardian.com/a-look-into-the-secrets-of-mcp/)*.*\\n\\n# Why Use Public MCP Servers?\\n\\nLeveraging publicly available MCP servers offers several advantages:\\n\\n# Notable Public MCP Servers\\n\\nHere are some prominent public MCP servers and what they offer:\\n\\n# 1. FastAPI MCP Server\\n\\nA flexible server built with FastAPI that lets you expose Python functions or wrap REST APIs into MCP-compatible endpoints. Great for rapid prototyping and microservice integration.\\n\\n# 2. GitHub MCP Server\\n\\nConnects AI agents with GitHub’s ecosystem. Enables repo browsing, issue tracking, code fetching, and more — ideal for code analysis or DevOps agents.\\n\\n# 3. Other Useful MCP Servers\\n\\n# Step-by-Step Guide: Using Public MCP Servers\\n\\n# Prerequisites\\n\\n`pip install requests fastapi uvicorn`\\n\\n`pip install requests fastapi uvicorn`\\n\\n# Step 1: Discovering MCP Servers via Manifest\\n\\nAll MCP servers expose a manifest at `/mcp/manifest`. This JSON file describes the server’s name, purpose, and available endpoints.\\n\\n`/mcp/manifest`\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n**Sample Output:**\\n\\n# Step 2: Querying the `/add` Endpoint\\n\\n`/add`\\n\\n**Output:**\\n\\n# Step 3: Using the `/reverse` Endpoint\\n\\n`/reverse`\\n\\n**Output:**\\n\\n# Step 4: Interacting with GitHub MCP\\n\\nExample: Get open issues for a repo like `octocat/Spoon-Knife`.\\n\\n`octocat/Spoon-Knife`\\n\\n***Note:*** *GitHub MCP servers may require a token for authentication. Always check the manifest for instructions.*\\n\\n# Bonus: Build Your Own FastAPI MCP Server\\n\\nWant to expose your own tools to an AI agent? Here’s a minimal example.\\n\\nRun the server:\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nPublic MCP servers are a powerful tool for AI developers. They provide plug-and-play access to a vast range of functionalities, enabling rapid innovation without reinventing the wheel. Whether you’re building intelligent agents, automating workflows, or exploring novel AI applications, MCP servers can significantly reduce integration effort and accelerate your development pipeline.\\n\\nExplore the ecosystem, try out the examples, and consider contributing your own MCP servers to the community!\\n\\n--\\n\\n--\\n\\n![Mihir Inamdar](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*rjvcg4Jt_wr1wb-IRpIsGg.jpeg)\\n![Mihir Inamdar](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*rjvcg4Jt_wr1wb-IRpIsGg.jpeg)\\n\\n## Written by Mihir Inamdar\\n\\nSupply Chain Analyst | AI Researcher\\n\\n## No responses yet\\n\\nHelp\\n\\nStatus\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nPress\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nPrivacy\\n\\nRules\\n\\nTerms\\n\\nText to speech\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 4: Awesome MCP Servers ---\\nURL: https://mcpservers.org/\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nMCP Server that connects AI agents to Chargebee platform.

(Source: [MuleSoft 2021 Connectivity Benchmark Report](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/reports/connectivity-benchmark)). With a growing number of demands and expectations both internally and externally, connecting applications in a seamless and scalable way continues to be a major challenge for organizations on the path of digital transformation. Simultaneously, new classes of middleware technology emerge at a rapid scale to address [application connectivity](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/reports/connectivity-benchmark) problems. [Service oriented architecture (SOA)](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/soa-integration-solution), [enterprise service bus (ESB)](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/what-mule-esb), [ETL](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/data-integration-open-source), [iPaas](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/cloudhub/ipaas-integration-platform-as-a-service), [virtualization](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/service-virtualization), [APIs](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/api-management), [Streaming](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/streaming-about), and [robotic process automation (RPA)](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-robotic-process-automation-rpa) are few examples of such classes of technologies and architecture styles.\\n\\nWith so many business applications, data types, and middleware technologies, IT architects are often faced with tough design decisions to deliver the most efficient integration solution that meets business requirements in a cost-efficient and timely manner. In this series of blogs, we will provide guidance on decomposing integration problems into their most basic and fundamental integration use cases. We further introduce the technologies and integration patterns that can be used to deliver those use cases.\\n\\nCommon integration technology classes\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nIn the year 2021, technology has been at the forefront for meeting many business demands, including applications connectivity. There are a variety of technology options that fulfill this space. In this blog, we will look at the technologies holistically as a group or class that share similar architecture and behavioral standards.\\n\\n![Image 11](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/wp-content/uploads/unnamed-1-2.png)\\n\\nAs we describe the integration use cases subsequently, we will use this list to identify the relevant technology classes.\\n\\nFoundational integration use cases\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nWhile there are many business scenarios for application and data integration, we believe that every business scenario can be broken down into the following unique and fundamental integration use cases. These use cases are building blocks and can be combined to develop more involved and complex use cases.\\n\\n### #1 Aggregation of data\\n\\nBusinesses consolidate data from multiple sources for semantic completeness and contextualization purposes. Within these use cases, data from multiple applications are copied into a central location for further analysis and processing, for example, data warehouses, data lakes, or dashboards.\\n\\n![Image 13](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\\n\\nSome of the common examples of business scenarios are:\\n\\n*   [Building a single view of customer](https://www.mulesoft.com/case-studies/api/royal-bank-of-canada)\\n*   [Migrating data from on-prem applications to a cloud-based data warehouse](https://www.mulesoft.com/case-studies/soa/oldcastle-precast)\\n*   Consolidating sensor data and ERP data for advanced analytics on usage patterns\\n*   Preparation of executive sales dashboards\\n\\n### #2 Streaming data ingestion\\n\\nMost organizations have modern devices and objects that are capable of instrumenting and generating data to reflect the current or past state of the device. This data is vital for an organization’s operations and needs to be ingested into a platform for downstream consumption and usage. Typically, such devices can generate data either at a slow pace (every minute or hour) or at a fast pace (sub-milli-second).\\n\\n![Image 15](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\\n\\nSome of the common examples of the business scenarios are:\\n\\n*   Processing IoT sensor data at edge locations\\n*   [Real-time consolidation of inventory across stores](https://www.mulesoft.com/case-studies/api/buffalo-wild-wings)\\n*   Consolidating user click data on retailer websites\\n*   Collecting and analyzing machine vibration data to predict failure\\n\\nlatest report\\n\\nLearn why we are the Leaders in API management and iPaaS\\n\\n[Read reports](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-leader)\\n\\n### #3 Data sync between multiple applications\\n\\nFor a given piece of data, there is generally a well-defined system of record where its lifecycle is managed. However, that data is often required within other systems to complete the business transactions within those applications. The data changes faster in the system of record and is required near real-time in the consuming applications. Consuming applications may further enrich or update certain information. More often than not, these consuming systems should not act as systems of record.\\n\\n![Image 17](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\\n\\nSome of the common examples of the business scenarios are:\\n\\n*   Upon creation of a new customer account, syncing the account details to ERP, CRM, and Financial applications. Updates to customer accounts can be made in the CRM applications and those updates are sent back to the system of record.\\n*   [Synchronizing customer data with the customer support applications so your front-line agents can better serve your customers.](https://www.mulesoft.com/case-studies/api/hologic)\\n\\n### #4 Sharing data with external partners\\n\\nAny given organization typically works with multiple external business partners, such as suppliers, contractors, government agencies, etc. These business partners are organizations on their own with different systems, processes, and applications. Data exchange between your organization and the partner organization, however, is critical to complete business transactions.\\n\\n![Image 19](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\\n\\nSome of the common examples of the business scenarios are:\\n\\n*   [Sharing purchase orders with your suppliers](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/whitepaper/api/supply-chain-management-edi-system)\\n*   Sharing invoices for payment purposes with your suppliers\\n*   Sending tax data with the government\\n*   Sharing machine’s operating parameters with the regulatory organization\\n\\n### #5 Broadcasting events\\n\\nEvents occur all the time within an organization. New hires, machine shutdowns or failures, expense approvals, payment issues, website traffic exceeding a certain threshold – all of these are classic examples of meaningful events that have downstream impacts and demand further actions. Identifying, capturing, and notifying these events to downstream consumers are critical aspects in these use cases.\\n\\n![Image 21](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\\n\\nSome of the common examples of the business scenarios are:\\n\\n*   Tracking a consignment’s shipment status\\n*   Sending notifications for customer order fulfillment status\\n*   [Tracking the inventory updates in real-time](https://www.mulesoft.com/case-studies/api/buffalo-wild-wings)\\n*   Experiencing a retailer website crash after a surge in user clicks\\n\\n### #6 Bulk or batch data movement\\n\\nThere is an ever-growing need to see data as quickly as possible, however, there are valid scenarios where delays in presenting information is acceptable or presenting information in real-time is not required. Such scenarios optimize and provide better utilization of the resources usage in a way that constant or online availability of processing resources is not required.\\n\\n![Image 23](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\\n\\nSome of the common examples of the business scenarios are:\\n\\n*   One-time migration of customer accounts from an old CRM to Salesforce\\n*   Periodic migration of invoices from ERP to payment systems\\n*   Nightly reconciliation and analysis of financial transactions from multiple applications\\xa0\\n*   Daily summarization of shipping and receiving transactions\\n\\n### #7 Synchronized data transfers or process triggers\\n\\nSynchronous data transfers are scenarios where the receiver of the information makes a request for data transfer and waits until the sender has transmitted the requested information. During the time the data is not received, any further processing at the receiver is suspended. Such scenarios are valid when there are strong dependencies between the requested data and subsequent transactions at the receiver.\\n\\n![Image 25](blob:http://localhost/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 7: Real-World ERP Examples: Success Stories and Lessons - Gestisoft ---\\nURL: https://www.gestisoft.com/en/blog/unlocking-success-real-world-erp-systems-examples-and-lessons-learned\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nSuccess story 3: Company C - e-commerce excellence with ERP systems Company background and e-commerce challenges.

The goal of ERP implementation is to integrate various business processes, such as finance, supply chain, human resources, and operations, into a single, unified system that streamlines and automates key operations.\\n\\nERP implementation is a complex and multi-faceted process that typically involves the following steps:\\n\\nERP implementation can be a complex and time-consuming process. It has [its own advantages and disadvantages](https://changemanagementinsight.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-erp/) but the benefits can be substantial, including improved efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced decision-making capabilities.\\n\\n#### 10 Successful ERP Implementation Examples\\n\\nFollowing are 10 ERP implementation examples from different industries\\n\\n**1. TD Bank Group**\\n\\nTD Bank’s migration to a cloud-based framework prompted its partnership with Microsoft for Microsoft Azure ERP. As one of its biggest challenges, TD Bank Group focuses on improving digital storage and customer experience.\\n\\nBy leveraging Microsoft Azure, TD Bank will integrate Office 365, leading to various advantages such as:\\n\\n**2. Amazon**\\n\\nAmazon.com is a technology giant that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. The company has implemented SAP as its ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) solution, which plays a crucial role in managing the various assets and operations of the company. SAP’s financial accounting and invoice verification capabilities are particularly valuable for Amazon, allowing the company to track its finances and assess its needs.\\n\\nIn addition to financial accounting, SAP’s ERP solution also helps Amazon manage its inventory, logistics, human resources, order management, and sales. This comprehensive approach to managing the various functions of the business has helped Amazon maintain its position as a global leader in e-commerce. The solution offers sellers a unique opportunity to keep track of their sales, retain customers, analyze profit margins, and improve the overall shopping experience for buyers.\\n\\nThe ERP solution offers a user-friendly interface with a variety of options, including an interactive analysis tool, product information, MRP, service, human resources, and customizable reports.

N&N Moving Supplies**\\n\\nN&N Moving Supplies, a family-owned supplier of moving equipment, streamlined its business operations with the implementation of an ERP system. As the company grew from one location in Georgia to three locations across multiple states and increased its workforce, the previous accounting and payroll systems on QuickBooks and a third-party provider became increasingly difficult to manage.\\n\\nTo address these challenges, N&N chose NetSuite ERP and worked with a partner, NOVAtime, to integrate a time-clock solution. This collaboration resulted in significant improvements, including:\\n\\nA 84% reduction in payroll processing time. Quicker account reconciliation. Greater accuracy in tracking hours and vacation time. The ability to monitor labor-cost trends across all three locations. Providing employees with personal ERP dashboards accessible through iPads on-site.\\n\\nThe success of N&N Moving Supplies in implementing their ERP system highlights the importance of managing employee morale. Many ERP implementations fail when employees do not feel a sense of ownership in the project. N&N was able to sidestep this issue by offering personalized dashboards and explaining the benefits to employees before the implementation.\\n\\nThe case study also demonstrates the value of working with a third-party partner. A partner can tailor the ERP system to the unique needs of the company, as was seen with N&N’s collaboration with NOVAtime\\n\\n**4.

Oracle ERP enables Starbucks to analyze revenue data, view expenses and sales information, all on a single screen. This centralized system provides convenient and quick access to crucial business information\\n\\n**5. Walmart**\\n\\nWalmart Inc. is a leading American retail corporation that operates a vast network of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores across the United States. With a market capitalization of over $500 billion, Walmart is among the largest corporations in the country. The company’s sales are roughly double those of its closest retail competitor, Amazon.\\n\\nIn 2018, Walmart entered into a five-year partnership with Microsoft for the deployment of Microsoft Azure, a cloud-based platform that supports multiple ERP systems. The partnership aims to bring the benefits like integration with cutting-edge block chain solutions; more efficient e-commerce opportunities; integration of existing ERP programs into Microsoft Azure platform; development of a cloud-based enterprise system; improved automation of warehouse operations and use of AI to manage supplier relationships.\\n\\nThanks to its current ERP system, Walmart has a competitive edge in technology. The system enhances supply chain management efficiency and strengthens integration and collaboration with suppliers. Furthermore, it helps the company improve worldwide management efficiency, further solidifying its position as a leader in the retail industry\\n\\n**6. Cadbury**\\n\\nCadbury, a 123-year-old British confectionery company, is now owned by the American snack foods giant Mondelez International. Despite its rapid success, the company faced difficulties in fulfilling its manufacturing and distribution needs. To address these issues, SAP was brought in to overhaul the supply chain, including a redesign of warehousing and distribution procedures.\\n\\nThe planning phase of the ERP adoption required frequent modifications and close collaboration between Cadbury’s management and the ERP vendors. Despite the lengthy process, it provided the company with a comprehensive real-time view of the core business.\\n\\nThe ERP implementation brought about significant improvements for Cadbury, including improved warehouse management, increased efficiency, and rapid expansion. The best-in-class vendors and their proactive decision-making capabilities helped to streamline the process and minimize any issues during the deployment stage. The vendor’s efficiency also resulted in cost savings for the company. Choosing the right partner, like Zillancer, can provide a more convenient and streamlined ERP solution\\n\\n**7. The Hershey Company**\\n\\nHershey’s is a globally recognized American chocolate manufacturing company, known for being one of the largest in the world.\\n\\nIn 1996, Hershey’s started its journey to modernize its outdated IT systems through an integrated ERP platform. The company chose to implement Seibel’s CRM software, Manugistics’ SCM, and SAP’s R/3 ERP software.\\n\\nDespite a suggested implementation timeline of 48 months, Hershey’s aimed to have the systems up and running within 30 months, ahead of the Y2K deadline.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Hershey’s busiest seasons for orders (around Halloween and Christmas) coincided with the ERP implementation, causing the team to cut back on crucial testing steps to meet the tight timeline. This led to unexpected problems and the systems’ inability to process orders, resulting in a loss of $100 million in Kiss and Jolly Rancher orders.\\n\\nFor any company considering or implementing ERP, Hershey’s experience provides valuable lessons. The two most important are to closely monitor the ERP schedule and to thoroughly test business processes and systems using a methodology that simulates real-world scenarios. Adhering to these recommendations will reduce the risk of failure and position a business for ERP success.\\n\\n**8. LG Electronics**\\n\\nLG Corporation is a well-known South Korean multinational conglomerate that specializes in home appliances and electronics. With over 114 subsidiaries, it is one of the most recognized brands in the world’s electronics industry.\\n\\nHowever, consolidating HR data for global reporting was a complex, time-consuming, and costly task due to the use of different HR programs by its subsidiaries. This, combined with ineffective management practices, was hindering the efficiency of HR staff members.\\n\\nIn response to these challenges, LG Electronics decided to switch to a single, integrated ERP system to simplify HR administration and improve the company’s ability to recruit and retain top talent. The company was also facing difficulties in operating globally, due to the growth of manual procedures, improper resource utilization, and ineffective decision-making.\\n\\nIt took LG Electronics five years to successfully implement its ERP solution, but the benefits were significant. The company achieved increased transparency in the hiring and employee evaluation process, flexibility for regions to make changes locally with the centralized HR Management system, enhanced HR management through real-time access to information for senior managers, improved document sharing and learning among staff members, leading to time and cost savings, and boosted employee satisfaction with the introduction of self-service options.\\n\\n**9. Fulton & Roark**\\n\\nFulton & Roark is a men’s grooming products company founded with the aim of offering products that cater to the needs of modern life.\\n\\nPreviously, the North Carolina-based company used a spreadsheet to manage its inventory and Sage Live desktop accounting software for its financial information. However, as the company’s revenues started to double annually, the leadership realized that the current processes were not keeping up with the growth.\\n\\nThe limitations of spreadsheets in accounting for fluctuating inventory costs and the lack of procedures in the accounting software to record the cost of goods sold, a vital financial metric, prompted the company to switch to a full-featured ERP.\\n\\nThe co-founders of the company decided to implement NetSuite ERP to centralize all their operations in one place. The implementation process took only three weeks and the results were immediate. The Fulton & Roark team was able to:\\n\\nThe success story of Fulton & Roark highlights the importance of having management support for an ERP implementation. In this case, the initiative was started by the co-founders, which experts say often leads to higher employee adoption. The company’s experience also shows that ERP rollouts do not have to take a long time, as their team was fully operational within just 20 days.\\n\\n**10. Green Rabbit**\\n\\nGreen Rabbit had been facing a challenge when trying to ship chocolate bars that were prone to melting during the summer months. To overcome this, they created a heat-sensitive supply chain and soon, other food companies sought their help. Thus, they rebranded as Green Rabbit, a supply chain logistics provider that specializes in the fast delivery of perishable goods.\\n\\nHowever, their new focus put their current processes to the test as they relied on QuickBooks, Excel, and email. Green Rabbit’s multiple databases were not able to communicate with each other, making real-time data analysis impossible. Additionally, the warehouse team often had to wait for assistance from the IT team.\\n\\nTo overcome these challenges, Green Rabbit implemented ERP and they were able to:\\n\\nThrough Green Rabbit’s successful ERP implementation experience, it is much easier to manage complex supply chain when when ERP is correctly implemented. And ERP is crucial for growth and further expansion of business.\\n\\nAnother important aspect is that ERP improves agility. For instance, after implementation of ERP, finance teams don’t need to spend hours on spreadsheets and paper records to analyse data and make decisions. Now they simply visualise date and forecast the future trends and adapt quickly to new situation.\\n\\n**Lessons Learnt from Successful ERP Implementation Examples**\\n\\nThe successful ERP implementation examples of companies like Amazon, Walmart, LG, Walmart etc. demonstrate the significant benefits that can be achieved through the implementation of an ERP system.

The ERP system should also be integrated with other systems and databases used by the company to ensure that accurate and up-to-date information is available to all users.\\n\\nThirdly, thorough testing and training are critical to ensure that the ERP system is working as expected and that employees are able to use the system effectively.\\n\\nFinally, it is important to have a well-planned and executed implementation process to ensure the success of the ERP implementation. This involves close collaboration between the company and its ERP software vendor and careful planning and execution of each stage of the implementation process.\\n\\nThe successful ERP implementation examples of these companies demonstrate the significant benefits that can be achieved through the implementation of an ERP system. These lessons can be applied by other companies to help them achieve their own successful ERP implementations.\\n\\n#### About The Author\\n\\n![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4edc59f30daa2c8e7cb2e375cdc83d16?s=150&d=mm&r=g)\\n\\n##### [Tahir Abbas](https://changemanagementinsight.com/author/tahir-abbas/)\\n\\n##### [Tahir Abbas](https://changemanagementinsight.com/author/tahir-abbas/)\\n\\n#### Related Posts\\n\\n![How to write a business case for change management](https://changemanagementinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Minimallist-cartoon-illustration-Instagram-post-template-for-business-438x246.png)\\n\\n## [How to Write a Business Case for Change Management?](https://changemanagementinsight.com/business-case-for-change-management/ \"How to Write a Business Case for Change Management?\")\\n\\n![Nudge Theory in HR](https://changemanagementinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nudge-Theory-in-HR--438x246.png)\\n\\n## [Nudge Theory in HR- How Nudging Transform HR Practices](https://changemanagementinsight.com/nudge-theory-in-hr/ \"Nudge Theory in HR- How Nudging Transform HR Practices\")\\n\\n![Nudge Theory in Business](https://changemanagementinsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Nudge-Theory-in-Business-438x246.png)\\n\\n## [Nudge Theory in Business – Small Changes Making Big Impact](https://changemanagementinsight.com/nudge-theory-in-business/ \"Nudge Theory in Business – Small Changes Making Big Impact\")\\n\\n### Search\\n\\n### Archives\\n\\n### Meta\\n\\n### Our Brands:\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 9: PDF ---\\nURL: https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/CO-AABD-CNTNT-FY18-03Mar-20-Azure-Databricks-Use-Cases-eBook.pdf\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nThree practical use cases with Azure Databricks 2 What this e-book covers and why Azure Databricks is a fast, easy, and collaborative Apache® Spark™ based analytics platform with one-click setup, streamlined workflows, and the scalability and security of Microsoft Azure.

Predicting and preventing customer churn is vital to a range of businesses.\\nIn this notebook we will use a pre-built model on Azure Databricks to analyze customer churn. With this model, we can predict when a customer is going to churn with 90% accuracy, so we can setup a report to show customers that are about to churn, and then provide a remediation strategy such as a special offer to try and prevent them from churning. In this example we are looking at cellular carriers, and the goal is to keep them from jumping to another carrier. This notebook: • Contains functionality that is relevant to Data Scientists, Data Engineers and Business users. • Lends itself to a data driven storytelling approach, that demonstrates how notebooks can be used within Azure Databricks.\\n• Uses a machine learning Gradient boosting algorithm implementation to analyze a Customer Churn dataset.\\n• Illustrates a simple churn analysis workflow. We use Customer Churn dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\\nThree practical use cases with Azure Databricks Notebook 1 7 Churn analysis demo %sh mkdir /tmp/churn wget http://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/db/churn.data -O /tmp/churn/churn.data wget http://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/db/churn.test -O /tmp/churn/churn.test --2017-08-25 19:52:36-- http://www.sgi.com/tech/mlc/db/churn.data Resolving www.sgi.com (www.sgi.com)... 192.48.178.134 Connecting to www.sgi.com (www.sgi.com)|192.48.178.134| :80... connected.\\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK Length: 376493 (368K) [text/plain] Saving to: ‘ /tmp/churn/churn.data’ 0K .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... 13% 131K 2s 50K .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... 27% 650K 1s 100K .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... 40% 336K 1s 150K .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... 54% 672K 1s 200K .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... 67% 57 .9M 0s 250K .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... 81% 667K 0s 300K .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... 95% 69.0M 0s 350K .......... ....... 100% 166M=0.8s 2017-08-25 19:52:37 (485 KB/s) -

Comparative analysis of MCP and A2A, highlighting their primary goals (tool/context integration vs. inter-agent communication), key technical differences, use cases, and how they can be complementary.\", research=True, content='## MCP and Google Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol: A Comparative Overview\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, initiated by Google and its partners, is an open standard enabling communication and interoperability between diverse AI agents [1, 3, 5, 6]. Its agent-centric design allows agents to discover capabilities via \"Agent Cards\" and collaborate on tasks like delegation and context sharing, fostering a multi-agent ecosystem [1, 3, 4, 6, 9]. A2A uses standard web protocols such as HTTP/JSON-RPC 2.0 [3, 4, 6].\\n\\nWhile both A2A and Anthropic\\'s Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhance AI interoperability, they address distinct needs [3, 6, 7]. MCP, often called the \"USB-C for AI,\" focuses on \"vertical integration,\" connecting AI models to external tools and data sources for real-time context and actions [3, 6, 8]. This resource-centric protocol utilizes JSON-RPC 2.0 over transports like stdio or Streamable HTTP [1, 4, 9]. A2A, conversely, focuses on \"horizontal integration,\" enabling agent-to-agent communication and coordination with stateful conversations [3, 6, 7, 8].\\n\\nGoogle explicitly positions A2A as complementary to MCP, stating that combining them unlocks true agentic AI [1, 3, 6, 7]. An A2A agent might delegate a task to another agent, which then uses MCP to interact with external tools or data sources [4, 6, 7]. This synergy orchestrates multi-agent collaboration via A2A, while MCP provides individual agents with essential tool and data access [3, 7, 8].\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] Protocol Introduction - Agent2Agent Protocol - The A2A Protocol Community: https://agent2agent.info/docs/introduction/\\n[2] google/A2A | DeepWiki: https://deepwiki.com/google/A2A\\n[3] Comprehensive Research on Google’s Agent2Agent(A2A) Protocol and ...: https://kingy.ai/blog/comprehensive-research-on-googles-agent2agenta2a-protocol-and-competing-protocols/\\n[4] Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Specification - google-a2a.github.io: https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/specification/\\n[5] GitHub - google-a2a/A2A: An open protocol enabling communication and ...: https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A\\n[6] A2A vs MCP: The Guide to AI Agent Protocols in 2025: https://aimojo.io/a2a-vs-mcp/\\n[7] A2A and MCP - Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A) - google-a2a.github.io: https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/0.2.2/topics/a2a-and-mcp/\\n[8] MCP vs A2A: Comprehensive Comparison of AI Agent Protocols: https://medium.com/@neo-cruz/mcp-vs-a2a-comprehensive-comparison-of-ai-agent-protocols-862a969bac47\\n[9] A2A vs MCP: A Comprehensive Protocol Comparison: https://dev.to/vishalmysore/a2a-vs-mcp-a-comprehensive-protocol-comparison-4o26\\n[10] A2A vs MCP: Understanding the Difference | A2A Protocol Documentation: https://a2aprotocol.ai/docs/guide/a2a-vs-mcp')], 'source_str': 'Search results: \\n\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: Transports - Model Context Protocol ---\\nURL: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nTransports in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provide the foundation for communication between clients and servers. await server.connect(transport); await server.connect(transport); SSE transport enables server-to-client streaming with HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication. 1. **Client-to-Server Communication**: Every JSON-RPC message from client to server is sent as a new HTTP POST request to the MCP endpoint - SSE streams from HTTP GET requests to the MCP endpoint async with http_client(\"http://localhost:8000/mcp\") as transport: The legacy SSE transport enabled server-to-client streaming with HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication.

A transport handles the underlying mechanics of how messages are sent and received.\\n\\n## [\\u200b](#message-format) Message Format\\n\\nMCP uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 as its wire format. The transport layer is responsible for converting MCP protocol messages into JSON-RPC format for transmission and converting received JSON-RPC messages back into MCP protocol messages.\\n\\nThere are three types of JSON-RPC messages used:\\n\\n### [\\u200b](#requests) Requests\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\",\\n  id: number | string,\\n  method: string,\\n  params?: object\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### [\\u200b](#responses) Responses\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\",\\n  id: number | string,\\n  result?: object,\\n  error?: {\\n    code: number,\\n    message: string,\\n    data?: unknown\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### [\\u200b](#notifications) Notifications\\n\\nCopy\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  jsonrpc: \"2.0\",\\n  method: string,\\n  params?: object\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n## [\\u200b](#built-in-transport-types) Built-in Transport Types\\n\\nMCP currently defines two standard transport mechanisms:\\n\\n### [\\u200b](#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio) Standard Input/Output (stdio)\\n\\nThe stdio transport enables communication through standard input and output streams.

It provides a unified framework for AI models to connect with external tools and data sources which helps in making communication between platforms efficient. This standard helps AI models to use real-time data easily which improves the accuracy and timely results.\\n\\n## Understanding MCP\\n\\nBefore MCP, AI systems faced various challenges when it came to accessing data. Each time a new data source and a custom connection needed to be built for better results. As AI models become more advanced, need to easily connect to different data sources increases rapidly. However old technologies are struggling in this which makes it slow to scale AI systems.\\n\\nMCP solves this issue by offering a single, easy-to-use protocol that helps AI models connect to any data source. Instead of creating separate connections for each service, developers can use one simple protocol to link multiple data sources. This saves time which makes things simpler and helps AI systems grow easily. It also ensures that data is secure and consistent which gives AI models reliable access to up-to-date information.\\n\\n****Now let\\'s understand its working and architecture of MCP****\\n\\n![mcp_architecture_](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250430122225855351/mcp_architecture_.webp)\\n\\nMCP\\'s architecture is designed to be both simple and flexible which helps in enabling good interaction between AI models and various data sources. It works by connecting three key components: ****MCP Servers****, ****MCP Clients**** and ****MCP Hosts****.\\n\\n### 1. MCP Servers (A, B and C):\\n\\nThese servers expose data from various sources to AI models. Each server connects to specific data sources either local or remote. Think of them as gateways that provide AI models with the necessary data and tools to perform tasks. These servers allow AI models to retrieve right information from databases, tools or repositories to perform the required action whether it’s answering questions, making decisions or generating outputs. Without these servers AI models would be separated from data sources which limits their ability to provide accurate and context-aware responses.\\n\\n### ****2. MCP Clients****\\n\\nMCP Clients are AI-powered applications such as Claude, IDE or other tools that connect directly to the MCP servers. These applications maintain a 1:1 connection with the servers which allows them to retrieve data or perform tasks based on the data they access. The client acts as the interface where AI models can interact with external data. Without this connection model wouldn’t be able to access or process external data sources directly.\\n\\n### ****3. MCP Hosts****\\n\\nMCP Hosts are the AI applications like Claude Desktop or IDEs that manage the connection between the MCP servers and MCP clients. They ensure smooth communication and stable connections which provides AI models with right tools and context to perform their tasks effectively. This architecture helps AI models to access different data sources through a single unified protocol helps in eliminating need for custom connectors and helps in simplifying integration.\\n\\n## Getting Started with MCP\\n\\nTo start using MCP developers should follow these simple steps:\\n\\n### 1. Install Pre-Built MCP Servers\\n\\n****Using Claude Desktop App:****\\n\\n****Using Command Line:****\\n\\nnpm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-google-drive  \\nnpm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-slack\\n\\nnpm list -g --depth=0\\n\\n### 2. Configure MCP Servers\\n\\n### 3. Integrate MCP with AI Models\\n\\n### 4. Contribute to Open-Source Repositories\\n\\n## Understanding MCP’s Key Features\\n\\n## Real-World Applications of MCP\\n\\nMCP helps in enhancing AI systems across industries by simplifying data access and improving connectivity. Here’s how MCP is applied in various sectors:\\n\\n### ****1. Enterprise System Integrations****\\n\\n### ****2. Developer Tools Integration****\\n\\n### ****3. AI-Powered Applications****\\n\\nMCP helps developers by enabling good connections between AI models and different data sources. By simplifying integrations it helps AI systems to become more intelligent, context-aware and scalable.\\n\\nA\\n\\n### Similar

sophisticated models face a fundamental challenge: isolation. They often operate disconnected from the real-time data, specific domain knowledge, and interactive tools needed to be truly effective in practical applications.1 Integrating these external resources has traditionally required complex, custom-built connections for every new data source or tool, creating a significant development and maintenance bottleneck.1\\n\\nEnter the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, MCP is an open protocol designed to standardize how AI applications connect to the systems where data lives and actions happen – content repositories, business tools, databases, APIs, and development environments.1 This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to MCP for developers and anyone interested in the future of connected AI, covering what it is, why it’s needed, how it works, and how to get started.\\n\\n**What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?**\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nAt its core, MCP is an open standard protocol that defines a common language for communication between AI applications (often called “clients” or “hosts” in MCP terminology) and external data sources or tools (represented by “servers”).1 Think of it like a universal adapter for AI.\\n\\nThe most common analogy used is that MCP is like **USB-C for AI applications**.7 Just as USB-C provides a standardized port to connect various peripherals (keyboards, monitors, storage) to your computer regardless of the manufacturer, MCP aims to provide a standardized way to “plug in” different data sources, tools, and functionalities into AI models and applications.7\\n\\nDeveloped and open-sourced by Anthropic 1, MCP is not a specific framework like LangChain, nor a single tool, but rather a specification – a set of rules – for interaction.11 Its goal is to foster an ecosystem where any compliant AI client can interact with any compliant tool server, promoting interoperability and simplifying the development of sophisticated, context-aware AI systems.1\\n\\n![Image 4](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdEZNrgnrFzrTRG5jYxoT5Inoc-r39xIY5-4Rdf_mg-eoDFDIj7nnZ0KU1M_v_ikE1fKhKhKrDqr1EQNk1suOQyFzbFCyjPLIXq8Cg-XXNqkZ6CTD-1vY20T1qJ1SKQyoXeI_Fmlw?key=MpreGYn6twvpBkWtYe2QPYF2)\\n#### **The Need for MCP: Why Standardize AI Connections?**\\n\\nThe emergence of MCP addresses critical limitations faced by LLMs and the developers building applications around them:\\n\\n*   **LLM Knowledge Gaps**: LLMs possess vast general knowledge, but it’s inherently limited to their training data, which quickly becomes outdated (e.g., knowledge cutoffs).2 Furthermore, they lack deep understanding of specialized, private, or real-time domain knowledge crucial for many business applications (e.g., internal company processes, specific project codebases, live financial data).2 Retraining models frequently is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.2\\n*   **The M x N Integration Problem**: Before MCP, connecting _M_ different AI applications or agents to _N_ different tools or data sources required potentially _M x N_ unique, custom integrations.4 Each new connection demanded bespoke code to handle different APIs, authentication methods, and data formats, leading to fragmented, brittle, and difficult-to-scale architectures.1\\n*   **Developer Burden**: This integration complexity consumes significant developer time and resources, diverting focus from building core application value.4 Maintaining these numerous custom connectors as APIs and tools evolve becomes a major ongoing challenge.3\\n\\nMCP aims to solve these issues by providing a unified interface. By standardizing the connection point, it transforms the M x N integration challenge into a much more manageable M + N problem: developers build M clients (one for each AI application) and N servers (one for each tool/data source), all speaking the same MCP language.4 This standardization promises to reduce complexity, enhance maintainability, and allow AI models to seamlessly access the timely, relevant context and capabilities they need to perform effectively.1\\n\\n#### **How MCP Works: Architecture and Core Concepts**\\n\\nMCP employs a client-server architecture designed for flexibility and extensibility.10 Understanding its components and concepts is key to grasping its operation:\\n\\n**1. Architecture Components:**\\n\\n*   **MCP Host**: This is the user-facing application where the interaction with the AI occurs. Examples include Anthropic’s Claude Desktop app, AI-powered IDEs like Cursor or Windsurf, or custom-built AI applications.10 The Host manages connections to one or more MCP Servers via MCP Clients and often orchestrates the interaction with the underlying LLM.10\\n*   **MCP Client**: Residing within the Host application, an MCP Client maintains a dedicated, one-to-one connection with a specific MCP Server.10 It handles the protocol communication (sending requests, receiving responses/notifications) with that server.20\\n*   **MCP Server**: This is a program (often lightweight) that exposes specific capabilities (tools, data access, prompts) related to an external system (like a database, API, file system, or application) according to the MCP specification.2 Servers can run locally on the user’s machine or remotely.2 They act as the bridge between the standardized MCP world and the specific functionalities of the external resource.5\\n\\n**2. Core Concepts & Capabilities:**\\n\\nMCP defines several key primitives that servers can expose to clients, enabling rich interactions beyond simple function execution 3:\\n\\n*   **Tools (Model-controlled)**: These are structured functions or actions that the LLM (via the Host/Client) can decide to invoke.3 Tools have defined parameters and return structured responses. Examples include querying a database, sending an email, creating a GitHub issue, or manipulating a file.3 This is conceptually similar to function calling but standardized under the MCP protocol.12\\n*   **Resources (Application-controlled)**: These represent structured, often read-only, data or content that the Host application can provide to the LLM as context.3 Resources could be files, database views, website content, or API endpoints providing information without significant side effects.12 They help ground the LLM with relevant information for its task.3 Cursor, for example, does not yet support Resources, highlighting the evolving nature of client implementations.22\\n*   **Prompts (User-controlled)**: Servers can provide predefined prompt templates or workflows designed to utilize the server’s tools and resources effectively.3 These can act like slash commands, allowing users to trigger complex operations with concise inputs, potentially injecting context from Resources or chaining multiple tool calls.21\\n*   **Sampling (Server-controlled)**: A powerful feature allowing the _Server_ to request LLM inference _from the Client_.10 The server can specify model preferences, system prompts, temperature, etc. This enables scenarios where a tool needs LLM capabilities itself (e.g., summarizing retrieved data before returning it) or for server-driven interactions, while keeping control over the LLM (and associated costs/privacy) with the client.18\\n*   **Roots**: Define specific locations (e.g., file paths) within the host environment that the server is authorized to interact with, establishing operational boundaries.18\\n*   **Notifications (Server-controlled)**: Allow the server to push asynchronous updates or information to the client without a preceding request, useful for real-time events.11\\n\\nThis distinction between Tools, Resources, and Prompts provides a more nuanced way to structure AI interactions compared to simpler function-calling mechanisms. It separates explicit actions (Tools) from contextual data (Resources) and user-invoked workflows (Prompts), offering greater clarity and control.3\\n\\n**3. Protocol and Transport:**\\n\\nMCP uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** as its underlying message format for requests, responses, and notifications, running over persistent connections.11 It supports two primary transport mechanisms:\\n\\n*   **stdio (Standard Input/Output)**: Used for communication when the Client (Host) and Server run as processes on the _same machine_. The Host manages the server subprocess, communicating via its stdin and stdout streams.9 This is simple and efficient for local integrations (e.g., accessing local files, running scripts).12\\n*   **HTTP with SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: Used for communication between processes that may be on different machines (remote) or even on the same machine via HTTP.9 The server uses SSE to push messages (notifications, asynchronous responses) to the client over a persistent HTTP connection, while the client sends requests via standard HTTP POST methods.11 This enables distributed architectures.11\\n\\nThe protocol defines a clear **connection lifecycle** involving initialization (handshake to exchange capabilities and versions), message exchange (requests, responses, notifications), and termination.11 It also includes standard error codes and mechanisms for progress reporting.20 The bidirectional nature, especially with SSE and notifications/sampling, allows for more dynamic and interactive workflows than traditional request-response API calls.13\\n\\n![Image 5](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeFrIcv9gAdSb_-OsZ5LHZQ-QUYNuYFb78PPMKIPfwJBB5tHSdvBg7lcyuP2YTF9W_x9mqSkLRuDoWO9AIEqKTwiiHtLhNGMjz2V_NsZo8C4shZm7cbbPe-n2IA88YUdgyLMGdT?key=MpreGYn6twvpBkWtYe2QPYF2)\\n#### **Getting Started with MCP**\\n\\nThere are several ways developers can start working with MCP:\\n\\n**1. Using Existing MCP Servers:**\\n\\nThe easiest way to begin is by leveraging the growing ecosystem of pre-built MCP servers. Several client applications already support MCP integration:\\n\\n*   **Claude Desktop**: Anthropic’s own desktop application allows users to connect to MCP servers (local stdio servers require a Claude for Work subscription currently).1 Users can configure servers to grant Claude access to local files, Git repositories, databases, etc..1\\n*   **Cursor**: This AI-first code editor integrates MCP as a “plugin system”.22 Developers can configure servers via mcp.json files (project-specific or global) to connect Cursor to databases, Notion, GitHub, Stripe, and more, allowing the AI agent to interact with these tools directly.22 Cursor supports both stdio and SSE transport types.22\\n*   **Other Clients/SDKs**: The OpenAI Agents SDK 9 and Microsoft’s C# SDK 23 also provide client capabilities, allowing developers to integrate MCP servers into their own custom agents or applications. Frameworks like LangChain also offer adapters.15\\n\\nTo use an existing server, you typically need to:\\n\\n*   Install the server software (if it’s a local tool/package).\\n*   Configure your MCP client application (e.g., Claude Desktop settings, Cursor’s mcp.json, or your SDK code) with the server’s connection details (command for stdio, URL for SSE) and any necessary environment variables (like API keys).9\\n*   The client application will then typically discover the server’s capabilities (tools, resources, prompts) and make them available to the LLM agent.9 User approval is often required before a tool is executed.22\\n\\n**2. Building Your Own MCP Server:**\\n\\nIf a server doesn’t exist for the tool or data source you need, you can build your own. The availability of SDKs simplifies this process:\\n\\n*   **Choose Language/SDK**: Official or community SDKs are available for languages like Python, TypeScript, and C#.1\\n*   **Define Capabilities**: Implement the logic for the Tools, Resources, or Prompts you want to expose. This involves writing the code that interacts with your target system (e.g., calling an API, querying a database, reading a file).23 Use clear, descriptive names and JSON schema definitions for tools and their parameters, as the LLM relies on these descriptions to decide when and how to use them.23\\n*   **Handle the Protocol**: Use the chosen SDK to handle the MCP communication details (JSON-RPC messaging, transport layer via stdio or SSE, connection lifecycle management).20 The SDK typically provides decorators or methods to register tools (e.g., “ in C#, @mcp.tool() in Python) and handle incoming requests like list_tools and call_tool.15\\n*   **Implement Best Practices**: Ensure robust input validation, comprehensive error handling, proper resource management, and secure handling of credentials or sensitive data associated with the underlying service.2\\n*   **Publish/Deploy**: Make your server accessible. For stdio servers, this might just involve packaging it as a CLI tool. For SSE servers, deploy it as a web service.23 Containerization (e.g., using Docker) is a common approach for packaging and distributing servers.23\\n\\nThe design focus on simple transport mechanisms like stdio and the availability of SDKs significantly lowers the barrier to entry for creating new servers. This strategy aims to rapidly populate the MCP ecosystem with a diverse range of tools, making the protocol more valuable and attractive for client applications to adopt. Wrapping an existing command-line tool or a simple script to expose its functionality via MCP can often be achieved with relatively minimal effort.12\\n\\n**3. Building Your Own MCP Client/Host:**\\n\\nFor those building AI applications or platforms, implementing an MCP client allows integration with the entire ecosystem of MCP servers:\\n\\n*   Discover and manage connections to multiple MCP servers (handling subprocesses for stdio or network connections for SSE).10\\n*   Implement the client-side MCP protocol logic (initialization, requesting capabilities, calling tools, handling responses and notifications).20\\n*   Integrate with an LLM to interpret user requests, select appropriate MCP tools/resources based on their descriptions, generate parameters, and process results.21\\n*   Provide a user interface for configuring servers, approving tool executions, and displaying outputs.22\\n\\n#### **MCP in Context: Comparison with Alternatives**\\n\\nMCP enters a landscape with existing methods for connecting LLMs to external capabilities. Understanding how it compares is crucial:\\n\\n**Feature****MCP (Model Context Protocol)****Function Calling (e.g., OpenAI)****RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Gen)****Agent Frameworks (e.g., LangChain)****ChatGPT Plugins (Legacy)**\\n**Primary Purpose**Standardize **connection** between AI & tools/data Translate NL to **API call schema****Retrieve & augment** context**Build & orchestrate** AI apps/agents Extend ChatGPT capabilities\\n**Nature**Open Protocol Standard 7 LLM Feature / API Specification Technique / Architecture Software Library / Toolkit Proprietary Platform Feature\\n**Focus**Runtime Interface & Interoperability 12 Intent Translation 32 Knowledge Injection 16 Application Development 34 Specific Platform Extension\\n**Standardization**High (Aims for universal standard) 4 Low (Vendor-specific formats) 4 N/A (Technique)Medium (Within framework) 34 Low (Platform-specific)\\n**Interaction**Bidirectional, Stateful (Tools, Resources, Prompts, Sampling) 13 Request-Response (Typically) 4 Primarily Retrieval 36 Defined by developer Request-Response 34\\n**Tool/Data Handling**External Servers encapsulate logic 12 Client implements execution logic 29 Vector DBs / Knowledge Bases Integrated within agent code 34 Hosted by developer\\n**Ecosystem**Growing, Open, Community-driven 1 Tied to LLM Provider Diverse tools/databases Centered around framework library Limited, Deprecated\\n**Key Advantage**Interoperability, Scalability (M+N) 17 Direct LLM intent mapping Access vast knowledge Rapid agent development Simple ChatGPT extension\\n**Key Limitation**Newness, Security (evolving) 11 Vendor Lock-in, Execution burden Can be complex, Retrieval quality Framework dependency Proprietary, Limited scope\\n\\n*   **MCP vs. Function Calling (FC)**: Function calling, as implemented by LLM providers like OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini, focuses on the LLM’s ability to translate a user’s natural language request into a structured format (often JSON) representing a function call with specific arguments.12 However, these formats are often vendor-specific, and the _client application_ is responsible for actually implementing the logic to execute that function call.4 MCP complements this by standardizing the _protocol and framework for executing_ these calls via external servers.29 It aims to be model-agnostic, decouples the tool implementation (server) from the agent (client), and supports richer, potentially bidirectional interactions.4 Essentially, FC helps the LLM decide _what_ action to take, while MCP provides the standardized “socket” for _how_ that action is performed by an external tool.32\\n*   **MCP vs. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: RAG is a _technique_ used to improve LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources (like documents stored in vector databases) and adding it to the prompt context.16 It primarily focuses on enhancing knowledge retrieval.36 MCP, as a _protocol_, can facilitate connections to various systems, including those performing RAG. An MCP server could certainly implement RAG as one of its capabilities (e.g., a Tool or Resource for searching documents).37 However, MCP also allows direct interaction with data sources without needing prior embedding/indexing (useful for structured data or APIs) and enables _actions_ via Tools, going beyond RAG’s typical passive retrieval scope.19 They are not mutually exclusive; MCP can provide the standardized plumbing _to_ a RAG system.37\\n*   **MCP vs. Agent Frameworks (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK)**: Frameworks like LangChain provide libraries and abstractions to help developers _build_ AI applications and agents, including managing prompts, state, and tool integrations within the agent’s code.11 MCP, in contrast, is a _protocol_ for _connecting_ agents to external, potentially independently running, tools/servers.11 They are complementary: frameworks can (and do) incorporate support for MCP, allowing agents built with them to communicate with MCP servers.9 MCP is particularly valuable when the developer _doesn’t control_ the agent’s core code (like using Claude Desktop or Cursor) and wants to add external tools, whereas frameworks are typically used when the developer _is building_ the agent itself.40\\n*   **MCP vs. ChatGPT Plugins**: OpenAI’s earlier Plugin system aimed to extend ChatGPT’s capabilities but was proprietary, primarily focused on request-response interactions, and didn’t achieve widespread, lasting adoption.24 MCP is positioned as an open, more flexible standard supporting richer interactions and aiming for a broader, more interoperable ecosystem.12\\n\\nThis comparative landscape highlights MCP’s specific niche: it’s not aiming to replace RAG techniques or development frameworks but to provide the missing standardized layer for runtime communication between AI agents and the vast world of external tools and data sources.\\n\\n#### **Weighing the Options: MCP Benefits and Considerations**\\n\\nAdopting MCP offers significant advantages but also comes with important considerations, especially given its relative youth.\\n\\n**The Upside (Benefits):**\\n\\n*   **Standardization & Interoperability**: This is MCP’s core promise. By defining a common interface, it drastically simplifies the integration landscape, moving from a complex M x N problem to a more manageable M + N scenario.4 This allows different AI clients and tool servers to connect seamlessly, much like USB-C devices.2\\n*   **Simplified Development & Maintenance**: Developers can build against a single protocol instead of numerous disparate APIs.1 This accelerates development, reduces integration overhead, and makes applications easier to maintain as tools or underlying LLMs change.1\\n*   **Rich Ecosystem & Reusability**: The open nature fosters a growing ecosystem of pre-built MCP servers that developers can readily plug into their applications.1 Tools built as MCP servers can be reused across multiple AI applications.12\\n*   **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: MCP directly addresses LLM limitations by providing access to real-time data and the ability to execute actions.2 This enables the creation of more powerful, context-aware, and agentic AI systems capable of complex workflows.3\\n*   **Flexibility**: Support for both local (stdio) and remote (SSE) communication provides deployment flexibility.12 Its design aims to be model-agnostic, reducing vendor lock-in.4\\n\\n**Considerations (Limitations & Risks):**\\n\\n*   **Newness and Maturity**: MCP is a young protocol, launched in late 2024.1 The ecosystem, while growing rapidly, is still maturing.6 Documentation, best practices, and tooling are continuously evolving.41 Early implementations might have limitations (e.g., Cursor’s initial lack of Resource support 22) or potential bugs.\\n*   **Learning Curve and Complexity**: While SDKs help, understanding the client-server architecture, protocol nuances (especially stateful aspects over SSE), and setting up servers requires a degree of technical expertise.17 Some critics find the protocol, particularly its bidirectional nature, potentially overly complex for simple tool use cases.13\\n*   **Security Risks**: This is arguably the most significant area of concern for the nascent protocol. The act of connecting powerful LLMs to tools that can access data and perform actions inherently introduces risks:\\n\\n*   _Authentication & Authorization_: Standardized, robust authentication mechanisms are crucial but were initially lacking and are still evolving.11 MCP servers that handle sensitive credentials (like OAuth tokens for external services) become attractive targets.30 Proper authorization within the server to limit tool actions is critical.2\\n*   _Server Compromise / Token Theft_: A compromised MCP server could potentially grant attackers access to multiple connected services via stored tokens.30\\n*   _Prompt Injection_: LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where malicious instructions hidden in seemingly benign input (data processed by the LLM, or even tool descriptions themselves) trick the AI into executing unintended, harmful tool calls.30 This is a fundamental challenge when mixing LLMs, tools, and untrusted data sources.31 Research papers and security analyses have demonstrated exploits like data exfiltration via cleverly crafted tool descriptions.31\\n*   _Excessive Permissions & Data Aggregation_: Servers might request overly broad permissions for the services they connect to, increasing the potential impact of a compromise.30 The centralization of access also creates data aggregation risks.30\\n*   _Malicious Servers (Tool Shadowing/Rug Pulls)_: A malicious server could potentially redefine its tools after initial user approval (“rug pull”) or intercept/override calls intended for legitimate servers (“tool shadowing”).31\\n*   _Mitigation_: Addressing these risks requires a multi-layered approach: secure server development practices (input validation, least privilege), vigilant client design (clear UI, mandatory user confirmation for actions 22), and potentially specialized security auditing tools and ongoing research.6 The rapid adoption of MCP underscores the urgency of developing and disseminating these security best practices.\\n*   **Adoption Hurdles**: MCP’s value proposition relies heavily on widespread adoption – a classic network effect challenge.17 Organizations may hesitate to adopt a new standard, especially if they have existing investments in other integration methods.41 Its initial focus appears geared towards developers and enterprise use cases rather than immediate consumer applications or enhancing local model performance.25\\n\\nThe success of MCP hinges on building a vibrant and trustworthy ecosystem. Its potential to simplify integration and empower AI agents is immense, but this potential must be balanced against the need for robust security measures and continued maturation of the protocol and its surrounding tooling. The value of MCP increases exponentially as more high-quality, secure servers become available and more client applications adopt the standard, reinforcing the importance of community contribution and adherence to best practices.\\n\\n#### **The Road Ahead: The Future of MCP**\\n\\nDespite its youth, MCP has gained significant traction since its November 2024 launch.1 Major AI development tools (Cursor, Claude Desktop), SDKs (OpenAI, Microsoft), and various companies are integrating it.1 A thriving community is rapidly building and sharing MCP servers, with hundreds now available.6 It’s increasingly seen as a foundational technology for the next generation of AI-native applications and agentic systems.6\\n\\nThe potential impact is substantial: transforming AI agents into truly capable assistants that can s\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 4: MCP -

In [Part 1](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/introduction-to-model-context-protocol/ \"Part 1\") , we explored the fundamental challenge MCP addresses: the complex web of custom integrations needed to connect diverse AI applications with the ever-growing universe of external tools and data sources – the “M x N” problem. We introduced MCP as a promising solution, an open standard designed to simplify this landscape into a more manageable “M + N” scenario by providing a universal communication layer. Often described as a “USB-C port for AI,” MCP aims to standardize how AI models plug into the context they need, fostering a more interoperable ecosystem.\\n\\nThis post, Part 2, shifts gears from the ‘why’ to the ‘how’. We’ll dive deep into the technical architecture that powers MCP, dissecting the protocol’s mechanics piece by piece. Understanding these underlying components is crucial for developers aiming to build robust MCP servers or integrate MCP clients into their AI applications. We will examine how MCP structures its messages, the data formats and transports it uses, and how it represents capabilities like tools and resources. By the end, you’ll have a detailed understanding of MCP’s architecture, preparing you for the step-by-step server implementation in Part 3.\\n\\nCommunication Foundation: JSON-RPC 2.0[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#communication-foundation-json-rpc-20)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we’ve set the stage, let’s begin our technical exploration by examining the very foundation of MCP communication: how do the different components – the Host application, the MCP Client, and the MCP Server – actually talk to each other? To ensure consistency and interoperability across the diverse ecosystem of AI applications and tools, MCP relies on a well-established standard for structuring these conversations. This brings us to the protocol’s core communication mechanism.\\n\\nThe communication between MCP Clients and Servers is built upon the **JSON-RPC 2.0** specification. This choice provides several advantages:\\n\\n*   **Standardization:** It leverages a well-defined, widely implemented, and understood remote procedure call protocol.\\n*   **Simplicity:** JSON-RPC 2.0 defines a relatively straightforward structure for requests, responses, and notifications.\\n*   **Data Format:** It utilizes JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for message serialization, which is human-readable, easily parsed across numerous programming languages, and inherently compatible with web technologies.\\n*   **Proven Foundation:** The protocol explicitly draws inspiration from the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which also successfully employs JSON-RPC to standardize communication between development tools and language servers.\\n\\nBy adopting JSON-RPC, MCP avoids reinventing fundamental RPC mechanisms. This strategic decision likely accelerated the development of MCP SDKs across various languages and lowers the adoption barrier, allowing the protocol’s focus to remain on the specific semantics of AI context exchange.\\n\\nStructured JSON Messages in MCP[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#structured-json-messages-in-mcp)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs discussed above, all MCP communications are built on **structured messages** following the JSON-RPC 2.0 standard. Every message is a JSON object containing specific fields that convey its intent and allow the recipient to understand how to process it. Key fields include:\\n\\n*   **`jsonrpc` (version):** Specifies the protocol version (always `\"2.0\"` for JSON-RPC 2.0). This field ensures both sides interpret the message format the same way.\\n*   **`id` (identifier):** A unique ID for pairing requests with responses. The sender assigns an `id` to each request, and the receiver uses the same `id` in the corresponding response. This can be a number or string; it’s used only for matching responses and is not needed for one-way messages (notifications).\\n*   **`method`:** A String indicating the name of the method to be invoked or the notification type. Examples include `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `$/progress`, or `$/cancelRequest`. This field is **REQUIRED** for both Requests and Notifications.\\n*   **`params` (or `payload`/`data`):** An object (or array) containing data needed to perform the method. This could be inputs to a tool, a resource identifier, or other context. It may be omitted if a method doesn’t require additional data.\\n*   **`result`:** Included in Response messages upon successful method execution. This field contains the value returned by the invoked method. It is **REQUIRED** on success and **MUST NOT** exist if the `error` field is present.\\n*   **`error`:** Included in Response messages when a method invocation fails. This field **MUST** be an Object containing:\\n    *   **`code`:** An Integer indicating the error type that occurred (using standard JSON-RPC error codes or potentially custom codes).\\n    *   **`message`:** A String providing a short description of the error.\\n    *   **`data` (optional):** A primitive or structured value containing additional information about the error. The `error` field is **REQUIRED** on failure and **MUST NOT** exist if the `result` field is present.\\n\\nThese fields make MCP messages self-descriptive and machine-readable. Notably, there is no explicit field for “message type” – instead, the presence or absence of certain fields defines the type. For example, a message with a `method` and no `result` or `error` is a **Request**; a message with `result` or `error` (but no `method`) is a **Response** to a prior request; and a message with a `method` but **no** `id` is treated as a one-way **Notification** (no response expected).\\n\\nMCP Transport Layers and Connection Flows[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#mcp-transport-layers-and-connection-flows)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is **transport-agnostic**, meaning it can operate over any channel capable of carrying JSON text. This flexibility allows MCP to support multiple transport layers—Standard Input/Output (STDIO), HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE), and WebSockets—each suited to specific use cases. Below, we explore these transport mechanisms, their connection flows, message framing, and their respective strengths and limitations.\\n\\n### Transport Layers[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#transport-layers)\\n\\nMCP supports three primary transport layers, each designed to balance latency, infrastructure compatibility, and interactivity:\\n\\n*   **Standard Input/Output (STDIO):**  \\n    STDIO leverages a process’s stdin and stdout streams for communication, typically when the MCP server runs as a local subprocess of the host application (similar to Language Server Protocol implementations).\\n    \\n    *   **Pros:** Extremely low latency (microseconds) due to no network overhead, simple setup for local plugins, and inherits OS-level security (only the user’s process can access it).\\n    *   **Cons:** Limited to local connections (cannot easily connect to remote servers), and requires the host to manage the server process lifecycle.\\n    *   **Use Cases:** Local integrations, such as an AI assistant spawning a tool-access server on the same machine to securely access the local filesystem or databases.\\n*   **HTTP + Server-Sent Events (SSE):**  \\n    This transport uses standard HTTP requests for client-to-server communication and a long-lived SSE connection for server-to-client streaming. It’s ideal for remote servers and one-way data streaming.\\n    \\n    *   **Pros:** Compatible with existing web infrastructure (e.g., proxies), supports real-time incremental results via server push, and works with web clients that cannot initiate arbitrary sockets.\\n    *   **Cons:** SSE is unidirectional (server-to-client only), requiring separate HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication. Managing dual channels (HTTP + SSE) adds complexity, and long-lived SSE connections may require special handling with load balancers or proxies.\\n    *   **Use Cases:** Cloud-based or remote MCP servers, such as an AI assistant connecting to a cloud data source that streams results as they become available (e.g., in a browser environment).\\n    *   **Note:** MCP is exploring _Streamable HTTP_ to unify HTTP+SSE into a single connection with streaming capabilities. As of the 2025 spec, SSE remains the primary HTTP streaming method, but future iterations may enhance this.\\n*   **WebSockets:**  \\n    WebSockets provide a persistent, full-duplex connection for bidirectional communication with low latency (milliseconds).\\n    \\n    *   **Pros:** True real-time two-way communication, single connection management, and efficient for interactive or high-frequency message exchanges.\\n    *   **Cons:** Requires WebSocket support, which may be restricted in some corporate networks, and involves slight overhead during connection handshaking.\\n    *   **Use Cases:** Interactive scenarios or long-running connections, such as an AI-powered IDE continuously interacting with a tool server for spontaneous notifications and commands.\\n\\nMCP’s JSON message format remains consistent across all transports, tunneled through the chosen mechanism. The choice of transport depends on deployment needs: STDIO for local plugins, HTTP+SSE for web-friendly streaming, and WebSockets for full-duplex interactivity.\\n\\n### Connection Flows and Message Framing[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#connection-flows-and-message-framing)\\n\\nEach transport defines how MCP messages are exchanged and framed (delimited) on the wire, ensuring reliable, ordered delivery of JSON-RPC messages. Below is an overview of the connection flows and framing for each transport:\\n\\n*   **STDIO Transport:**\\n    \\n    *   **Connection Flow:** Used when the MCP client (within the host application) and server run on the same machine. The host application launches the server as a subprocess (e.g., npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/root). Communication occurs over the server’s stdin and stdout pipes, effectively forming the “connection.”\\n    *   **Message Framing:** JSON-RPC messages are exchanged over stdin/stdout. Simple implementations may separate messages with newlines, but robust systems may use explicit framing, prefixing each JSON message with headers like Content-Length: NNN\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n, followed by the JSON payload. This ensures accurate message delimitation, especially for large messages.\\n    *   **Use Case Example:** A local tool server handling file system operations or Git commands, where the host manages the server’s lifecycle.\\n*   **HTTP + SSE Transport:**\\n    \\n    *   **Connection Flow:** Supports communication between clients and servers on the same or different machines. The MCP server runs independently, exposing an HTTP endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:3000/mcp). The client initiates a standard HTTP connection, and the server uses SSE to push JSON-RPC messages asynchronously over a persistent connection.\\n    *   **Message Framing:** SSE uses a text-based framing protocol. Messages are sent as “events” with fields like event: message\\\\_type (optional), data: json\\\\_payload, id: (optional), and retry: (optional). Each field is a line, and events are terminated by a double newline (\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n). MCP JSON-RPC messages are encoded as JSON strings within the data: field of an SSE event. Clients send commands via separate HTTP POST requests to the server’s endpoint (e.g., /mcp).\\n    *   **Use Case Example:** A web-based client accessing a remote MCP server for shared services or APIs, with the server streaming results back.\\n*   **WebSockets Transport:**\\n    \\n    *   **Connection Flow:** A single WebSocket connection is established, enabling full-duplex communication. The client connects to the server’s WebSocket endpoint, and both parties can send messages at any time after the handshake.\\n    *   **Message Framing:** WebSockets naturally carry JSON text frames bidirectionally. Each MCP JSON-RPC message is sent as a single WebSocket frame, with no additional framing required beyond the WebSocket protocol’s built-in message boundaries.\\n    *   **Use Case Example:** An interactive AI IDE sending commands and receiving spontaneous server notifications over a single, low-latency connection.\\n\\n### Transport Abstraction[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#transport-abstraction)\\n\\nMCP’s design ensures the higher-level protocol (JSON-RPC + capabilities) remains consistent across transports. Developers can switch transports—e.g., from STDIO during development to WebSockets in production—without altering the core logic of their MCP client or server. SDKs or transport handlers abstract away the details of framing and connection management, allowing seamless transitions between transports based on deployment requirements.\\n\\nCapabilities in MCP: Tools, Resources, and Prompts[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#capabilities-in-mcp-tools-resources-and-prompts)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow that we understand the communication foundation and how messages are transmitted we can focus on how communication actually occurs. First..How does an AI client know what capabilities a server provides? MCP includes a discovery mechanism. When a connection is first established, the client and server perform a **handshake** (initialization sequence) where they exchange supported features. The client sends an `initialize` request identifying the MCP protocol version it speaks and perhaps its own capabilities or preferences. The server responds with an acknowledgment that includes its available capability types (whether it has resources, tools, and/or prompts, and possibly other info like server name/version). This exchange ensures both sides know what the other supports (for example, a server might declare it supports the “resources” and “tools” features, but not “prompts”). After this, the client sends an `initialized` notification to finalize the handshake.\\n\\nsequenceDiagram title MCP Session Initialization participant Client participant Server Note over Client,Server: MCP = Message Control Protocol Client-\\\\>Server: initialize Request  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"method\": \"initialize\", \"params\": {...}} activate Server alt Success Server--\\\\>Client: initialize Response  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"result\": {\"capabilities\": {...}, \"serverInfo\": {...}}} else Failure Server--\\\\>Client: Error Response  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"error\": {\"code\": -32000, \"message\": \"Server not ready\"}} end deactivate Server Client-\\\\>Server: initialized Notification  \\n{\"method\": \"initialized\", \"params\": {}} Note right of Server: MCP Session is now established\\n\\nOnce initialized, the client can query the server for specific capability details. MCP defines the below **standard JSON-RPC methods** for discovering and using capabilities:\\n\\n*   **`resources/list`:** Discovers what resources the server offers. The server returns a list of resource descriptors (each typically includes a `uri`, a human-friendly `name` or description, and maybe a MIME type or other metadata).\\n    \\n*   **`resources/read`:** Requests the content of a specific resource identified by URI. The server returns the resource data (text content, or binary data encoded in base64, along with metadata like MIME type).\\n    \\n*   **`tools/list`:** Retrieves the list of available tools (actions) the server can perform. The response is an array of tools, each with a `name`, a description of what it does, and an `inputSchema` (often a JSON Schema or similar) describing the expected parameters for that tool. The schema helps the client (and ultimately the AI) understand how to call the tool correctly (what inputs are required).\\n    \\n*   **`tools/call`:** Invokes a named tool with provided parameters. The server executes the action and returns the result. The result format depends on the tool (could be any JSON data structure defined by that tool’s contract) or returns an error if something went wrong during execution.\\n    \\n*   **`prompts/list` and `prompts/get`:** Similarly, list available prompt templates and retrieve the content of a selected prompt.\\n    \\n\\nUsing these standardized methods, an MCP client can systematically explore what a server can do. For instance, right after initialization, a client might call `tools/list` and `resources/list` to get a full inventory of capabilities. The **capabilities object** exchanged in the handshake is high-level (just indicates categories supported), while these list methods provide the detailed inventory of each category. This two-step discovery (handshake negotiation, then detailed listing) allows MCP to remain **extensible** – new categories of capabilities or new features can be introduced in future versions, and clients/servers will negotiate if they support them.\\n\\nConnection Establishment and Capability Discovery[#](https://pradeepl.com/blog/model-context-protocol/mcp-protocol-mechanics-and-architecture/#connection-establishment-and-capability-discovery)\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEstablishing a connection in MCP involves both setting up the transport and performing a protocol handshake. At the transport level, this means connecting via STDIO, HTTP+SSE, or WebSocket as discussed earlier (e.g. launching a subprocess for STDIO, or opening an HTTP connection for SSE events). Once the low-level connection is open, the **MCP handshake** occurs at the JSON-RPC level:\\n\\n1.  **Client Initialization:** The client (host application) sends an `initialize` JSON-RPC **request** to the server. This message typically includes parameters such as the MCP protocol version and the client’s own supported features or preferences. For example, the client might send the version and indicate it’s ready to handle certain server capabilities. It may also specify a list of “roots” or a scope for resources (to limit what the server should have access to, e.g., only a certain directory). The `initialize` request carries an `id` since the client expects the server to reply. A sample initialization request is below\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 1,\\n  \"method\": \"initialize\",\\n  \"params\": {\\n    \"processId\": null,\\n    \"clientInfo\": {\\n      \"name\": \"ExampleHostApp\",\\n      \"version\": \"1.2.0\"\\n    },\\n    \"capabilities\": {\\n     },\\n    \"trace\": \"off\",\\n    \"rootUri\": null,\\n    \"workspaceFolders\": null\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\n2.  **Server Response (Capabilities Ack):** The server responds to `initialize` with a JSON-RPC **response** containing its details. In the response’s `result`, the server includes information such as:\\n    \\n    *   **`capabilities`:** The capability types it supports (e.g. `{ \"resources\": {}, \"tools\": {} }` to advertise that it provides resources and tools).\\n    *   **`serverName` and `serverVersion`:** Identification of the server (helpful for logging or UI).\\n    *   Optionally, any other info or negotiated settings (for example, some servers might send a `sessionId` or accepted protocol version if negotiation was needed).\\n    \\n    The server’s response confirms the protocol version (usually it will mirror what the client requested if compatible) and lists what features it can offer. This capability negotiation allows the client to adjust its behavior if needed and is designed for backwards-compatibility as MCP evolves. A sample initialization response is below.\\n    \\n    ```json\\n    {\\n      \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n      \"id\": 1,\\n      \"result\": {\\n        \"capabilities\": {\\n          \"tools\": {\\n            \"supported\": true\\n          },\\n          \"resources\": {\\n            \"supported\": true\\n          },\\n          \"prompts\": {\\n            \"supported\": false\\n          }\\n        },\\n        \"serverInfo\": {\\n          \"name\": \"SampleMCPServer\",\\n          \"version\": \"0.1.0\"\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n    \\n    copy\\n    \\n3.  **Client Acknowledgment:** After receiving a successful initialize result, the client sends an `initialized` **notification** (a JSON-RPC message with a `method` but no `id`) to signal that it received the server’s capabilities and that the connection is fully established. This tells the server that the client is ready and any startup procedures can be considered done. There is no response to a notification.\\n    \\n\\nAt this point, the MCP session is live and ready for use. The next step is usually **capability discovery**: the client will call the listing methods to get available resources, tools, or prompts. This can be done immediately after initialization, or later on demand when the AI needs something. It’s common for a client to do it upfront so that an AI agent can be aware of what’s available in its context.\\n\\nLet’s walk through an example of discovering a resource and then using it, to illustrate the message flow and structures. The diagram below illustrates the typical flow for invoking a tool, showing both successful and failed outcomes.\\n\\nsequenceDiagram title MCP Resource Access Sequence participant MCP-Client participant MCP-Server Note over MCP-Client,MCP-Server: MCP Session already established MCP-Client-\\\\>MCP-Server: resources/list Request  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"method\": \"resources/list\", \"params\": {}} activate MCP-Server alt Success MCP-Server--\\\\>MCP-Client: resources/list Response  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"result\": {\"resources\": \\\\[\"demo://greeting.txt\", \"demo://info.txt\"\\\\]}} else Failure MCP-Server--\\\\>MCP-Client: resources/list Error Response  \\n{\"id\": 1, \"error\": {\"code\": -32600, \"message\": \"Invalid request\"}} end deactivate MCP-Server Note left of MCP-Client: Client processes resource list  \\nand identifies needed URI MCP-Client-\\\\>MCP-Server: resources/read Request  \\n{\"id\": 2, \"method\": \"resources/read\", \"params\": {\"uri\":\"demo://greeting.txt\"}} activate MCP-Server alt Success MCP-Server--\\\\>MCP-Client: resources/read Response  \\n{\"id\": 2, \"result\": {\"contents\": \"Hello, World!\"}} else Failure MCP-Server--\\\\>MCP-Client: resources/read Error Response  \\n{\"id\": 2, \"error\": {\"code\": -32602, \"message\": \"Resource not found\"}} end deactivate MCP-Server Note left of MCP-Client: Client processes resource content\\n\\n**Example – Listing and Reading a Resource:** Suppose the MCP server provides access to a simple resource (say, a text file). After the handshake, the client can ask for a list of resources:\\n\\n```json\\n// Client -> Server: discover available resources\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 1,\\n  \"method\": \"resources/list\",\\n  \"params\": {}\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nThis is a request for the server’s resource inventory. The `params` are empty here because no additional data is needed to list everything. The server would reply with a JSON-RPC response containing a list of resources:\\n\\n```json\\n// Server -> Client: list of resources (result of resources/list)\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 1,\\n  \"result\": {\\n    \"resources\": [\\n      {\\n        \"uri\": \"demo://greeting.txt\",\\n        \"name\": \"Greeting File\",\\n        \"description\": \"A friendly greeting text file\",\\n        \"mimeType\": \"text/plain\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nIn this fictional example, the server has one resource (`greeting.txt`) identified by the URI `demo://greeting.txt`. It provides a name and description for the resource, and indicates the MIME type is plain text. (In a real scenario, there could be many resources listed. The URI scheme `demo://` here is arbitrary; some servers might use file paths or other URI schemes like `file://` or custom scheme names.)\\n\\nNow that the client knows a resource exists, the AI (or user) can decide to retrieve it. To get the content of `demo://greeting.txt`, the client sends a `resources/read` request:\\n\\n```json\\n// Client -> Server: request to read a specific resource\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 2,\\n  \"method\": \"resources/read\",\\n  \"params\": { \"uri\": \"demo://greeting.txt\" }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nThis request includes the `uri` of the desired resource as a parameter. The server will attempt to read that resource and respond. If successful, it returns a `result` containing the content:\\n\\n```json\\n// Server -> Client: content of the resource (result of resources/read)\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 2,\\n  \"result\": {\\n    \"contents\": [\\n      {\\n        \"uri\": \"demo://greeting.txt\",\\n        \"text\": \"Hello from MCP!\",\\n        \"mimeType\": \"text/plain\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nHere, the server returned the content of the file: the text `\"Hello from MCP!\"` as plain text. We see that the result wraps the data in a `contents` array – this is an MCP convention since a resource could be multi-part or might return multiple chunks (but in this simple case it’s just one text blob). The `uri` is echoed back to clarify what this content corresponds to (useful if batched) and the MIME type is included as metadata.\\n\\nIf the resource cannot be found or accessed, the server would instead return an error. For example, if the client requested a URI that doesn’t exist:\\n\\n```json\\n// Server -> Client: error response (resource not found)\\n{\\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\\n  \"id\": 2,\\n  \"error\": {\\n    \"code\": 404,\\n    \"message\": \"Resource not found\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\ncopy\\n\\nThis indicates the request failed. The error object contains a numeric `code` and a `message` explaining the failure. In this case we used an HTTP-style `404` code for clarity, but MCP doesn’t mandate specific codes beyond the JSON-RPC standard ones. Some implementations use JSON-RPC’s predefined error codes or domain-specific codes. The key is that an error response always has the `error` field instead of `result`, and the original request `id` so the client knows which call failed.\\n\\nThrough this discovery sequence, the client learned what resources are\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 5: A survey of agent interoperability protocols: Model Context Protocol ... ---\\nURL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02279\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nHelp | Advanced Search Subjects: | Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) Cite as: | arXiv:2505.02279[cs.AI] | (orarXiv:2505.02279v1[cs.AI]for this version) | https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.02279Focus to learn morearXiv-issued DOI via DataCite (pending registration) References & Citations BibTeX formatted citation Bibliographic and Citation Tools Recommenders and Search Tools arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.

It can be a real challenge. In 2025, Agent-to-Agent (A2A) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged as the go-to **standards for building robust, multi-agent AI systems**.\\n\\nBut this isn’t an **A2A vs MCP** showdown-they’re made to work side by side. Each solves a distinct problem, and together they form the foundation of enterprise-grade, agentic AI.\\n\\nLet’s break down what makes A2A and MCP the backbone of modern agentic AI, why**you need both**, and how they’re changing the game for [developers](https://aimojo.io/ai-agent-builders/), marketers, and AI enthusiasts.\\n\\nWhat’s the Deal with A2A and MCP?\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nHere’s how each protocol tackles a different aspect of AI agent collaboration and integration.\\n\\n### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol\\n\\n![Image 5: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol by Google](https://aimojo.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Agent-to-Agent-A2A-Protocol-by-Google-1024x728.webp)\\n\\nImg Source: [Google Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/)\\n\\nA2A, cooked up by Google and a posse of big tech partners, is an open protocol that lets [independent AI agents](https://aimojo.io/build-ai-agents-llama-4-autogen/) communicate and collaborate-even if they’re built by different vendors or running on different clouds. Think of it as the WhatsApp group chat for your AI agents, where they can:\\n\\nExchange goals and context\\n\\nDelegate tasks\\n\\nShare results and artifacts\\n\\nWork across different platforms and clouds\\n\\nA2A is built on web standards like HTTP and [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC), making it dead simple to slot into your existing stack. The protocol is all about secure, structured, and scalable teamwork between agents-no more siloed bots doing their own thing.\\n\\n### Model Context Protocol (MCP)\\n\\n![Image 6: Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture](blob:http://localhost/1bbdb6c329e90f7e5d267f85b12efd07)![Image 7: Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture](https://aimojo.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Model-Context-Protocol-MCP-architecture-1024x511.webp)\\n\\nImg Source: [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)\\n\\nMCP, on the other hand, is [Anthropic’s brainchild](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (the folks behind Claude). If A2A is about [agent-to-agent](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/) banter, MCP is the “USB-C port” for AI-connecting your LLMs or agents to external tools, databases, APIs, and knowledge bases. Before MCP, every new tool meant another custom connector (ugh). Now, with MCP, any compliant data source can plug into any MCP-aware agent, giving you:\\n\\n*   Real-time, structured context for your models\\n*   Standardised tool and data integration\\n*   One protocol to rule them all (no more spaghetti code)\\n\\nMCP is what makes your AI actually useful-pulling in live data, triggering actions, and keeping responses fresh and relevant.\\n\\nA2A vs MCP: What’s the Actual Difference?\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nHere’s the quick-and-dirty comparison, so you can see why both are essential:\\n\\n| **Aspect** | **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** | **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Purpose | Connects and coordinates multiple agents | Connects agents to external tools/data |\\n| Key Functionality | Task delegation, teamwork, context sharing | Tool/data integration, real-time context |\\n| Created by | Google & partners | Anthropic (Claude), now multi-vendor |\\n| Ecosystem | Microsoft, Google, Atlassian, Salesforce | Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic |\\n| Analogy | Teamwork protocol for AI agents | Universal plug for AI-to-tool connections |\\n\\n**A2A Alone:**Imagine a company with AI agents for finance, marketing, and HR. A master agent can delegate “build a budget” or “plan a campaign” to others via A2A. But without MCP, each agent is stuck with its own knowledge-no access to live data or external tools.\\n\\n**MCP Alone:**Picture a chatbot that’s plugged into your product database and shipping APIs using MCP. It’s a responsive, tool-rich assistant-but it can’t coordinate with other agents to solve multi-step, cross-domain problems.\\n\\n**Together:**Now, combine them. Your agents can not only talk to each other (A2A) but also tap into any tool or data source they need (MCP). That’s how you build real, [enterprise-grade agentic AI](https://aimojo.io/qwen3-ai-agents-rag-systems/) systems.\\n\\n### Why This Matters: Real-World Use Cases\\n\\n![Image 8: A2A-MCP Customer Service AI Agent](https://aimojo.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A2A-MCP-Customer-Service-AI-Agent.webp)\\n\\n#### Multi-Agent Workflows\\n\\n*   **Customer service:** One agent handles support tickets, another handles billing, and a third manages escalation-all coordinated via A2A, each pulling real-time data via MCP.\\n*   **Supply chain:** Procurement, logistics, and inventory agents work together, sharing context and accessing live supplier data.\\n\\n#### Enterprise Automation\\n\\n*   **Marketing:**Content agents generate copy, [SEO agents](https://aimojo.io/ai-content-optimization-tools/) optimise it, analytics agents track performance-all collaborating through A2A, with MCP feeding them up-to-date stats and trends.\\n*   **DevOps:**Requirements agents pass specs to code-gen agents, which trigger test agents, all while pulling docs and code snippets via MCP.\\n\\n![Image 9: A2S-MCP AI Marketing Agent](blob:http://localhost/4104d32498ddcfebc64d9618ba9e69fd)![Image 10: A2S-MCP AI Marketing Agent](https://aimojo.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A2S-MCP-AI-Marketing-Agent.webp)\\n\\n![Image 11: AI Healthcare with A2A-MCP](blob:http://localhost/3307afe07e4f49cf2559baa311e1b5db)![Image 12: AI Healthcare with A2A-MCP](https://aimojo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AI-in-Mental-Health.webp)\\n\\n#### Healthcare & Finance\\n\\n*   Patient intake agents, diagnostic bots, and insurance processors coordinate care, pulling in [medical records](https://aimojo.io/ai-medical-scribes/) and policy data through MCP, and handing off tasks via A2A.\\n\\n### The Technical Lowdown: How A2A and MCP Work\\n\\n**A2A Protocol Features**\\n\\n**Agent cards:**JSON profiles advertising capabilities\\n\\n**Structured task lifecycles:**Pending, in-progress, completed\\n\\n**Modular messaging:**Text, audio, video, images, code\\n\\n**Security:**OAuth2, API keys, role-based access\\n\\n**MCP Protocol Features**\\n\\n**Client-server architecture:** Hosts, clients, servers\\n\\n**Tool/function calling:**Standardised tool use for LLMs\\n\\n**Context management:** Structured context, state persistence\\n\\n**Security:** Resource-level permissions, no shared API keys\\n\\n🔗 **Integration Example:** A user asks, “Create a quarterly report.”\\n\\n*   The [orchestrator agent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agent-orchestration) (A2A) delegates finance, analytics, and HR tasks to specialised agents.\\n*   Each agent uses MCP to fetch live data, run queries, or generate charts.\\n*   Results are shared back through A2A, and the orchestrator compiles the final report.\\n\\n### Getting Started with A2A and MCP\\n\\nFor those looking to dive in:\\n\\n![Image 13: Getting Started with A2A and MCP](blob:http://localhost/3ae4d04f916712e5394829daa66ef1f5)![Image 14: Getting Started with A2A and MCP](https://aimojo.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Getting-Started-with-A2A-and-MCP-1024x683.webp)\\n\\n**Start Small**\\n\\nBegin with two agents on localhost-one sending a structured query via A2A, and another receiving the task, using MCP to look up data from an API, and returning results.\\n\\n**Layer into Existing Tools**\\n\\nBoth protocols are designed to complement your current stack, not replace it. Add a protocol layer to your existing applications rather than rebuilding from scratch.\\n\\n**Focus on Standards**\\n\\nYour agents should speak protocols, not hardcoded APIs. This first step builds true autonomy and interoperability as you scale.\\n\\nBy leveraging both A2A for [agent collaboration](https://aimojo.io/ai-agent-builders/) and MCP for tool integration, you\\'re building the foundation for truly intelligent, modular, and scalable AI systems that can evolve with your business needs.\\n\\n### Quickfire FAQ\\n\\n#### When should I choose A2A over MCP?\\n\\nUse A2A for multi-agent workflows that require task delegation, lifecycle management, and peer-to-peer coordination across distributed AI systems.\\n\\n#### When does MCP become essential?\\n\\nMCP is ideal for scenarios needing dynamic tool integration, database access, or API calls during inference to enrich your agent’s responses with live data.\\n\\n#### Can existing cloud platforms support A2A and MCP?\\n\\nYes-major vendors like Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure now offer managed sidecar proxies and SDKs for seamless integration of A2A and MCP into your enterprise stack.\\n\\n#### How does A2A discover and connect agents?\\n\\nAgents publish “Agent Cards” via JSON over HTTP, advertising capabilities and endpoints so that peers can discover, authenticate, and negotiate tasks dynamically.\\n\\n### Final Thoughts\\n\\nCombining A2A and MCP unlocks true agentic AI: secure, **standardized collaboration plus real-time tool integration**. These open protocols empower multi-agent AI systems-from [customer service bots](https://aimojo.io/ai-chatbots-customer-service/) fetching live data to DevOps agents automating CI/CD.\\n\\n![Image 15: How A2A and MCP work together](blob:http://localhost/9654ec8dbc431daf4972bcb25aed1f1e)![Image 16: How A2A and MCP work together](https://aimojo.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/How-A2A-and-MCP-work-together-1024x555.webp)\\n\\nBy layering A2A’s structured messaging with MCP’s universal tool access, enterprises can build scalable, modular AI workflows without vendor lock-in.

These protocols represent different approaches to solving the complex challenge of enabling AI systems to work together effectively. This article provides a comprehensive comparison of MCP and A2A, examining their technical differences, ecosystem integration, use cases, and future outlook.\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\n![MCP vs A2A Protocol Comparison]()\\n\\nAI is rapidly evolving from single-model systems into complex ecosystems of tools and agents that reason, delegate tasks, and collaborate. As this evolution accelerates, the need for standardized protocols that enable these agents to communicate effectively becomes increasingly critical.\\n\\nThe emergence of competing standards in the AI ecosystem reflects the industry’s recognition of this need. Both Google and Anthropic have introduced protocols that aim to address different aspects of AI agent communication, potentially setting the stage for what some observers have called the “AI Agent Protocol Wars.”\\n\\nProtocol standardization will play a pivotal role in shaping AI’s future, defining not just how systems communicate with one another, but also determining who builds what, which tools thrive, and how quickly ecosystems connect and evolve.\\n\\n# Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol)\\n\\nMCP, or Model Context Protocol, was developed by Anthropic to standardize how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI assistants. It enables secure, two-way connections between models and external tools and data systems.\\n\\n![How MCP Works: Connecting Models to External Tools and Data]()\\n\\n# Origin and Development\\n\\nAnthropic introduced MCP as an open standard designed to facilitate building agents and workflows on top of LLMs. The protocol has gained significant traction in the community, with OpenAI recently announcing their adoption of the standard, signaling strong industry support.\\n\\n# Core Concepts and Architecture\\n\\nMCP follows a client-server model where host applications can connect to multiple servers:\\n\\n# Primary Use Cases and Design Goals\\n\\nMCP is primarily designed to facilitate tool use by AI models, focusing on organizing what agents, tools, or users send into the model. Its main goal is to provide AI models with access to external data sources and tools, enabling them to become more context-aware and capable of complex tasks.\\n\\n# How MCP Connects Models with External Tools and Data\\n\\nMCP servers expose APIs and endpoints that allow MCP clients to connect and exchange information. This creates a standardized way for AI models to interact with tools such as databases, APIs, business tools, repositories, and development environments. By connecting LLMs with external data systems, agents can return more intelligent, context-aware responses in complex AI workflows.\\n\\n# Understanding A2A (Agent-to-Agent)\\n\\nA2A, or Agent-to-Agent, is Google’s recently released open protocol designed specifically for agent-to-agent communication. According to Google’s documentation, A2A standardizes how AI agents communicate with one another.\\n\\n![How A2A Works: Enabling Agent Discovery and Communication]()\\n\\n# Origin and Development\\n\\nGoogle introduced A2A with an emphasis on creating a standard for interoperable, multi-agent systems.

In the A2A documentation, Google states that “A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic’s MCP, which provides helpful tools and context to agents.”\\n\\nGoogle provides an example of a car repair shop to illustrate how the protocols might work together:\\n\\n## Areas of Potential Conflict or Redundancy\\n\\nDespite Google’s positioning, there are areas where the protocols may overlap or conflict:\\n\\n## Industry Perspectives on Protocol Competition\\n\\nIndustry voices have raised questions about whether the two protocols will truly coexist peacefully. Solomon Hykes, CEO of Dagger and former Docker executive, noted: “In theory they can coexist, in practice I foresee a tug of war. Developers can only invest their energy into so many ecosystems.”\\n\\nAs Hykes points out, tools are evolving into more agent-like systems, and agents are increasingly relying on tools to function effectively, making the distinction between the two less clear-cut.\\n\\n## The Parallel with Historical Protocol Wars\\n\\nThe current situation draws parallels to historical protocol competitions, such as the battle between XML/SOAP and JSON in web services. In that case, JSON’s simplicity ultimately won out over the more complex but feature-rich alternatives.\\n\\nThis suggests that the protocol that offers the best balance of capability and simplicity may ultimately achieve wider adoption, regardless of technical superiority in specific domains.\\n\\n# Future Outlook\\n\\n## Likely Evolution of Both Protocols\\n\\nBoth protocols are likely to evolve significantly as they gain adoption and respond to developer feedback:\\n\\n## Potential for Convergence or Divergence\\n\\nThe future relationship between the protocols could take several forms:\\n\\n## Impact on the Broader AI Agent Ecosystem\\n\\nThe development of these protocols will significantly impact how AI agent ecosystems evolve:\\n\\n## Factors that Will Determine the Dominant Standard\\n\\nSeveral key factors will influence which protocol(s) achieve dominance:\\n\\n# Recommendations for Developers\\n\\n## When to Choose MCP\\n\\nDevelopers should consider MCP when:\\n\\n## When to Choose A2A\\n\\nA2A may be more appropriate when:\\n\\n## Strategies for Hedging Protocol Investments\\n\\nDevelopers can hedge their bets by:\\n\\n## Preparing for Multi-Protocol Environments\\n\\nFor the near term, developers should prepare for environments where both protocols exist by:\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nMCP and A2A represent different approaches to solving the challenge of AI system communication and coordination. While MCP focuses on connecting models with tools and data, A2A emphasizes inter-agent communication and coordination.\\n\\nGoogle has positioned A2A as complementary to MCP, but questions remain about whether the two protocols will peacefully coexist or compete for developer mindshare. Historical technology competitions suggest that simplicity and ease of use often win out over technical superiority.\\n\\nThe emergence of these protocols reflects the industry’s recognition that AI is moving beyond single-model systems toward complex ecosystems of coordinating agents. Whether through MCP, A2A, or both, the standardization of AI communication will accelerate innovation and enable more sophisticated AI applications.\\n\\nAs this space continues to evolve, developers should stay informed about both protocols, making pragmatic choices based on their specific use cases while remaining flexible enough to adapt as the ecosystem develops. The protocol wars may be just beginning, but their outcome will shape the future of AI for years to come.\\n\\n# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\\n\\n## Are MCP and A2A competing or complementary protocols?\\n\\nWhile Google has positioned A2A as complementary to MCP, there is significant overlap in their capabilities. Google argues that MCP focuses on tool orchestration while A2A handles agent-to-agent communication. However, as tools become more agent-like and agents rely more on tools, this distinction becomes blurred. In practice, developers may need to choose one ecosystem to invest their resources in, creating a competitive dynamic despite the theoretical complementarity.\\n\\n## Can I implement both MCP and A2A in the same project?\\n\\nYes, it’s technically possible to implement both protocols in the same project. For complex systems, you might use MCP for connecting your AI models to tools and data sources, while using A2A for communication between multiple agents. However, this approach would require maintaining compatibility with both ecosystems and potentially dealing with redundancies in functionality.\\n\\n## Which protocol has better security features?\\n\\nBoth protocols incorporate security considerations, but with different emphases. MCP focuses on secure connections between models and external systems, with granular permissions for accessing tools and data. A2A emphasizes secure information exchange between agents, with additional considerations for agent discovery security. The best choice depends on your specific security requirements and threat model.\\n\\n## Which protocol is easier to learn and implement?\\n\\nBased on early developer feedback, MCP appears to have a more straightforward learning curve, focused on connecting models to tools. The implementation is generally more straightforward and well-documented. A2A involves more complex concepts around agent discovery and coordination, potentially resulting in a steeper learning curve for developers.\\n\\n## Will one protocol eventually win out over the other?\\n\\nHistorical technology competitions suggest that simplicity, ease of use, and ecosystem support often determine which standards prevail. While it’s too early to predict a definitive winner, factors such as developer adoption, major platform support, and the ability to solve real-world problems efficiently will be crucial. Given OpenAI’s adoption of MCP, it currently has stronger industry momentum, but Google’s backing of A2A ensures it will remain a significant player.\\n\\n## Are there any open-source implementations available for these protocols?\\n\\nYes, both protocols have open-source implementations. MCP has a growing ecosystem of implementations across different platforms and tools, with active community contributions. A2A is newer but has Google-backed reference implementations available. The open-source landscape for both protocols continues to evolve rapidly as developers experiment with different implementations and extensions.\\n\\n## How do these protocols affect the development of AI applications?\\n\\nThese protocols significantly reduce the complexity of building sophisticated AI applications. They provide standardized ways to connect AI models with external tools (MCP) or other agents (A2A), eliminating the need for custom integration code. This standardization accelerates development cycles, improves interoperability, and enables more complex AI workflows than would be possible with isolated models.\\n\\n# Additional Resources\\n\\nTo deepen your understanding of these protocols and stay current with their development:\\n\\nThese resources provide detailed technical guidance and practical examples that complement the comparative analysis presented in this article.\\n\\n📌 Originally published on [Toolworthy.ai](<https://www.toolworthy.ai/blog/mcp-vs-a2a-protocol-comparison>) — your go-to resource for AI protocols and tool comparisons.\\n\\n--\\n\\n--\\n\\n![Neo Cruz](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*OrEFkmfa-X9IFbFSvP8p4g.png)\\n![Neo Cruz](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*OrEFkmfa-X9IFbFSvP8p4g.png)\\n\\n## Written by Neo Cruz\\n\\nSharing the latest trends, reviews, and tutorials on powerful AI tools.

Include how MCP connects clients, servers, and LLMs.\\nRequires Research: \\nTrue\\n\\nContent:\\n## Model Context Protocol (MCP): Architectural Overview for Developers\\n\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) employs a client-server architecture to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with external context and tools [1]. Hosts, such as LLM applications or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), initiate connections and contain MCP Clients. Each Client maintains a one-to-one, stateful connection with an MCP Server, which provides capabilities like resources, tools, and prompts [1, 3, 5]. This modular design aims to simplify AI integrations by allowing servers to focus on specific functionalities [5].\\n\\nCommunication between clients and servers adheres to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, ensuring structured message exchange via requests, responses, and one-way notifications [2, 4].

Its agent-centric design allows agents to discover capabilities via \"Agent Cards\" and collaborate on tasks like delegation and context sharing, fostering a multi-agent ecosystem [1, 3, 4, 6, 9]. A2A uses standard web protocols such as HTTP/JSON-RPC 2.0 [3, 4, 6].\\n\\nWhile both A2A and Anthropic\\'s Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhance AI interoperability, they address distinct needs [3, 6, 7]. MCP, often called the \"USB-C for AI,\" focuses on \"vertical integration,\" connecting AI models to external tools and data sources for real-time context and actions [3, 6, 8]. This resource-centric protocol utilizes JSON-RPC 2.0 over transports like stdio or Streamable HTTP [1, 4, 9]. A2A, conversely, focuses on \"horizontal integration,\" enabling agent-to-agent communication and coordination with stateful conversations [3, 6, 7, 8].\\n\\nGoogle explicitly positions A2A as complementary to MCP, stating that combining them unlocks true agentic AI [1, 3, 6, 7]. An A2A agent might delegate a task to another agent, which then uses MCP to interact with external tools or data sources [4, 6, 7]. This synergy orchestrates multi-agent collaboration via A2A, while MCP provides individual agents with essential tool and data access [3, 7, 8].\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] Protocol Introduction - Agent2Agent Protocol - The A2A Protocol Community: https://agent2agent.info/docs/introduction/\\n[2] google/A2A | DeepWiki: https://deepwiki.com/google/A2A\\n[3] Comprehensive Research on Google’s Agent2Agent(A2A) Protocol and ...: https://kingy.ai/blog/comprehensive-research-on-googles-agent2agenta2a-protocol-and-competing-protocols/\\n[4] Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Specification - google-a2a.github.io: https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/specification/\\n[5] GitHub - google-a2a/A2A: An open protocol enabling communication and ...: https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A\\n[6] A2A vs MCP: The Guide to AI Agent Protocols in 2025: https://aimojo.io/a2a-vs-mcp/\\n[7] A2A and MCP - Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A) - google-a2a.github.io: https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/0.2.2/topics/a2a-and-mcp/\\n[8] MCP vs A2A: Comprehensive Comparison of AI Agent Protocols: https://medium.com/@neo-cruz/mcp-vs-a2a-comprehensive-comparison-of-ai-agent-protocols-862a969bac47\\n[9] A2A vs MCP: A Comprehensive Protocol Comparison: https://dev.to/vishalmysore/a2a-vs-mcp-a-comprehensive-protocol-comparison-4o26\\n[10] A2A vs MCP: Understanding the Difference | A2A Protocol Documentation: https://a2aprotocol.ai/docs/guide/a2a-vs-mcp\\n\\n'}}\n",

       "\n",
       "Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, initiated by Google and its partners, is an open standard enabling communication and interoperability between diverse AI agents [1, 3, 5, 6]. Its agent-centric design allows agents to discover capabilities via \"Agent Cards\" and collaborate on tasks like delegation and context sharing, fostering a multi-agent ecosystem [1, 3, 4, 6, 9]. A2A uses standard web protocols such as HTTP/JSON-RPC 2.0 [3, 4, 6].\n",
       "\n",
       "While both A2A and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) enhance AI interoperability, they address distinct needs [3, 6, 7]. MCP, often called the \"USB-C for AI,\" focuses on \"vertical integration,\" connecting AI models to external tools and data sources for real-time context and actions [3, 6, 8]. This resource-centric protocol utilizes JSON-RPC 2.0 over transports like stdio or Streamable HTTP [1, 4, 9]. A2A, conversely, focuses on \"horizontal integration,\" enabling agent-to-agent communication and coordination with stateful conversations [3, 6, 7, 8].\n",
       "\n",
       "Google explicitly positions A2A as complementary to MCP, stating that combining them unlocks true agentic AI [1, 3, 6, 7]. An A2A agent might delegate a task to another agent, which then uses MCP to interact with external tools or data sources [4, 6, 7]. This synergy orchestrates multi-agent collaboration via A2A, while MCP provides individual agents with essential tool and data access [3, 7, 8].\n",

       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a robust client-server architecture, enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly integrate with external context and tools. Its design, leveraging JSON-RPC over various transports like STDIO or HTTP streaming, allows servers to expose capabilities such as resources, executable tools, and predefined prompts. The vibrant MCP ecosystem includes official examples like Filesystem and Fetch, as well as company-backed integrations for databases and enterprise systems like GitHub. While MCP focuses on this \"vertical integration\"—connecting LLMs to external data—Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol addresses \"horizontal integration,\" facilitating communication and coordination between diverse AI agents. Both protocols are complementary, with A2A agents able to leverage MCP for critical tool and data access, paving the way for sophisticated, collaborative AI systems.\n",
